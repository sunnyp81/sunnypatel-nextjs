B2B content marketing fails when agencies apply B2C tactics. Here's what actually works.

## Why B2B Content Marketing Differs

B2B buyers research thoroughly. Sales cycles span weeks or months. Multiple stakeholders influence decisions. Content must address entire buying committees.

## Strategic B2B Content Framework

**Stage 1: Awareness** -- Industry insight reports, problem-focused guides, trend analysis.

**Stage 2: Consideration** -- Solution comparison guides, methodology explanations, case studies.

**Stage 3: Decision** -- Detailed case studies, ROI calculators, implementation guides, testimonials.

## Content That Generates B2B Leads

Original research, comprehensive guides, detailed case studies, problem-solution content, and comparison content.

## SEO for B2B Content

B2B keywords have lower volume but higher value. Target problem-based queries, solution evaluation queries, and comparison queries.

## B2B Content Distribution

Owned channels (website, email, LinkedIn), earned channels (guest contributions, speaking, podcasts), and paid channels (LinkedIn sponsored, retargeting).

## Common B2B Content Mistakes

Product-focused content, ignoring search intent, inconsistent publishing, neglecting technical elements, measuring vanity metrics.

## Building B2B Content Authority

Show don't tell: specific methodologies, detailed frameworks, implementation guidance, transparent results. Go deeper than competitors.

## Content Production: In-House vs Agency

Hybrid approach works best: in-house owns strategy, agency handles production at scale, content briefs bridge the gap.

## Realistic B2B Content Timelines

Months 1-3: Foundation. Months 3-6: Building momentum. Months 6-12: Compounding returns. Year 2+: Sustained advantage.

## When to Invest in B2B Content

Works best for complex products, long sales cycles, multiple decision-makers, high lifetime value, and competitive markets.
