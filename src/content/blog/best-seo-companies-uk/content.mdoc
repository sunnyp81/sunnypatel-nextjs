This is a list of the best SEO companies in the UK based on methodology, published results, and specialisation — not paid placements. As an independent SEO consultant, I have no financial relationship with any agency listed here. I am included on this list myself (transparently labelled), which means you can evaluate my approach alongside theirs and decide which fits your business.

Most "best SEO agency" lists charge £500-£5,000 for a featured spot. Every company on those lists paid to be there. This one does not work that way.

**Selection criteria:** verifiable case studies, publicly demonstrated methodology, client retention evidence, specialist depth or breadth of capability, and fit across different business types and budgets.

## Rise at Seven — Best for Creative Link Earning

**Based in:** Sheffield, with London and US offices

[Rise at Seven](https://riseatse7en.com) built their reputation on creative-led SEO — campaigns designed to earn links through digital PR, data journalism, and content that genuinely gets covered in national press. They have produced campaigns for major UK brands and demonstrated organic link acquisition at scale through newsjacking, data-led reports, and creative concepts that attract coverage without outreach spam.

**Best for:** Consumer brands, e-commerce businesses, and companies in industries where editorial coverage in mainstream media is achievable. Works well for businesses willing to invest in campaign-style content rather than incremental content production.

**Strengths:**
- Strong track record of link acquisition through earned media rather than purchased placements
- Creative team that understands both journalism and search — a rare combination
- Publicly shared case studies with verifiable traffic data

**Considerations:**
- Creative-led approach requires client involvement and approval cycles for campaign concepts
- Less suited to B2B, technical, or regulated industries where editorial coverage is harder to achieve
- Pricing typically starts at £3,000-£6,000/month

## Aira — Best for Data-Driven Digital PR

**Based in:** Northampton (remote-first)

[Aira](https://aira.net) specialises in the intersection of digital PR and SEO, with a team known for publishing research-backed campaigns that attract links from high-authority publications. They have produced transparent reports on their own methodology, including honest post-mortems on campaigns that underperformed. That transparency is unusual in an industry where agencies routinely hide failures.

**Best for:** Businesses wanting to build domain authority through earned links alongside on-page SEO. Particularly strong for mid-market companies in competitive verticals where authority is the differentiating factor.

**Strengths:**
- Honest, data-driven culture — publishes internal research including failure analysis
- Strong understanding of both the SEO and PR disciplines
- Good track record in content-led link acquisition

**Considerations:**
- Like most digital PR agencies, success depends partly on media climate and newsworthiness
- Less focus on semantic content architecture compared to methodology-first specialists

## Blue Array — Best Specialist Agency for Pure SEO

**Based in:** Reading, Berkshire

[Blue Array](https://bluearray.co.uk) is one of the UK's specialist SEO agencies — meaning SEO is all they do, not one department among many. Based in Reading (locally relevant to this site), they have worked with large e-commerce and retail brands, and publish detailed SEO research through their blog. Specialist agencies typically provide more senior attention per pound spent than full-service agencies.

**Best for:** Mid-market to enterprise businesses wanting deep SEO expertise without paying for services they do not need. Strong fit for e-commerce, retail, and B2C businesses.

**Strengths:**
- Pure SEO focus means everyone in the company understands search
- Strong technical SEO capability demonstrated in published case studies
- Local to Reading and Berkshire — useful if you prefer in-person collaboration

**Considerations:**
- Less focus on content marketing and digital PR than some competitors
- Enterprise-level pricing for most engagements

## Reboot Online — Best for Statistics and Research Content

**Based in:** London

[Reboot Online](https://rebootonline.com) runs controlled SEO experiments and publishes their findings publicly — a methodology rare enough to be genuinely valuable. Their research on internal linking, title tag formats, and content structure has been cited widely across the SEO industry. They also produce statistics-driven content for clients as a link acquisition strategy, building on the same research-backed approach they use internally.

**Best for:** Businesses that want an evidence-based agency and value published SEO research over thought leadership marketing. Strong for competitive markets where differentiated content strategy is required.

**Strengths:**
- Genuine SEO research methodology rather than recycled best practices
- Demonstrated ability to rank statistics-heavy content for difficult keywords
- Transparent about methodology and testing processes

**Considerations:**
- Research-heavy approach requires patience — this is not a fast-results agency
- Best results come with longer engagements (12+ months)

## Propellernet — Best for Ethical and Sustainable Brands

**Based in:** Brighton

[Propellernet](https://propellernet.co.uk) focuses on businesses whose values align with theirs — sustainability, purpose-driven brands, and companies with genuine stories to tell. They are an employee-owned agency with a strong culture, which tends to reduce staff turnover and improve client relationship quality. Their approach combines [content strategy](/services/content-briefs/) with link acquisition and technical SEO.

**Best for:** B-Corp certified businesses, sustainable brands, charities, and purpose-driven companies where authentic storytelling is central to marketing.

**Strengths:**
- Employee-owned model reduces the churn that damages client relationships at investor-backed agencies
- Strong editorial content capability
- Good cultural alignment for brands where ethics matter

**Considerations:**
- Selective about clients — they will decline work that conflicts with their values
- Less suited to purely commercial e-commerce or financial services

## Impression Digital — Best Full-Service Digital Agency with Strong SEO

**Based in:** Nottingham, with London office

[Impression Digital](https://www.impressiondigital.com) provides integrated digital marketing including SEO, PPC, digital PR, and analytics. For businesses wanting a single agency to manage multiple channels, Impression offers genuine SEO depth alongside their paid media capability — which is rare in full-service agencies. They have appeared in multiple agency award shortlists and published transparent case studies.

**Best for:** Mid-market businesses wanting integrated organic and paid search under one agency relationship. Works well when SEO and PPC strategies need to be coordinated for maximum return.

**Strengths:**
- Strong integration between SEO and PPC teams
- Award-recognised digital PR capability
- Good regional presence outside London without London agency pricing

**Considerations:**
- Full-service model means you pay for capabilities you may not use
- Senior involvement may decrease as engagement matures

## Greenpark — Best for Enterprise E-Commerce SEO

**Based in:** London

[Greenpark](https://greenparkweb.com) focuses on content-first SEO for large e-commerce businesses, with a strong track record in competitive retail categories. They combine content production at scale with technical SEO, which suits enterprise e-commerce where both dimensions need to operate simultaneously at volume.

**Best for:** Enterprise e-commerce businesses, large retailers, and brands competing across thousands of product and category pages.

**Strengths:**
- Content production at scale without sacrificing quality
- Strong understanding of e-commerce technical SEO (indexation, faceted navigation, structured data)
- Experience managing large page inventories

**Considerations:**
- Not suited to SMEs — minimum engagement sizes reflect enterprise focus
- Content-volume approach may not suit B2B or niche specialist markets

## Sunny Patel SEO — Best for Semantic SEO and Topical Authority

**Based in:** Reading, Berkshire

*Disclosure: This is my own practice. I am including myself because excluding the author of a "best SEO companies" list would be more misleading than transparent inclusion.*

My approach is built on [semantic SEO methodology](/services/semantic-seo/) — the discipline of building topical authority through entity relationships, comprehensive content coverage, and content architecture that helps search engines understand what your site is definitively about. This differs from campaign-style SEO or volume-driven content production.

I work with a small number of clients directly, which means senior involvement throughout — not a junior handoff after the first month. I publish my methodology publicly on this blog rather than treating it as a proprietary secret, which means you can evaluate my thinking before committing to an engagement.

**Best for:** SMEs, B2B businesses, SaaS companies, and professional services firms that want a methodical, long-term SEO foundation rather than quick wins. Particularly strong for businesses in competitive markets where topical depth is the path to ranking. Also suited to businesses that have struggled with agencies and want direct senior access.

**Strengths:**
- [Semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) and [topical authority](/services/topical-authority/) specialist — deep methodology not available at generalist agencies
- Direct consultant access throughout — no account managers
- [AI search optimisation](/services/ai-search-optimisation/) integrated into all strategies, not offered as an upsell

**Considerations:**
- Sole practitioner — limited execution capacity for very large content volume requirements
- Not suited to businesses wanting one agency to manage all digital channels

**Starting from:** £1,200/month. [Get in touch](/contact/) for a free initial conversation.

## What to Ask Any Agency Before Signing

Regardless of which company you approach, these questions separate genuinely capable providers from those that rely on sales process:

1. **"Show me Search Console data from a client in my industry."** Results that cannot be verified did not happen.
2. **"Who specifically will work on my account? Can I meet them?"** Senior pitch, junior delivery is standard at many agencies.
3. **"What deliverables do I own if we end the engagement after 3 months?"** You should own all strategy documents, audits, and content.
4. **"How has your methodology changed in the last 12 months?"** The SEO landscape changed substantially in 2024-2025. An agency that cannot answer this is not evolving.
5. **"What realistic results can I expect at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months?"** Vague promises are a red flag. [How long SEO takes](/blog/how-long-does-seo-take/) gives you the benchmarks to evaluate any answer.
