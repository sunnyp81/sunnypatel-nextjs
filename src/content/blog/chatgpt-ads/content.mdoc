OpenAI just opened a new front in the attention wars. ChatGPT -- with its 800 million monthly users -- is becoming an advertising platform.

## The Basics

OpenAI is testing ads in the US for logged-in adults on the free tier and the $8/month "Go" plan. Ads appear at the bottom of responses. Personalisation is on by default. No ads near health, mental health, or political topics. No ads to under-18s. Plus, Pro, and Enterprise subscribers remain ad-free.

## Why This Platform Is Different

**Context depth is unmatched.** A Google search provides a keyword. A ChatGPT conversation reveals intent, constraints, preferences, objections, and emotional state in natural language.

**The user is leaning in.** Users are actively problem-solving.

**Generative ad creative.** AI could dynamically highlight different product features depending on user interests.

## The Targeting Opportunity

Intent-based monetisation. Rather than targeting demographics or keywords, you'd target moments of intent. Potential vectors include conversational topics, stated preferences, problem patterns, and purchase intent signals.

## What We Don't Know Yet

Auction mechanics, targeting granularity, measurement and attribution, creative specs, inventory volume, and geographic rollout.

## Strategic Considerations

This sits between search and social. Works best for considered purchases: software, professional services, travel, education, financial products. Your offering needs to be genuinely helpful in context.

## What to Do Now

1. Watch the beta closely
2. Audit your product information
3. Think about AI visibility generally
4. Prepare for measurement challenges
5. Budget allocation: 5-10% of test-and-learn allocation

## The Bigger Picture

ChatGPT advertising is the first significant crack in Google's grip on intent-based marketing. The paid media landscape is fragmenting.
