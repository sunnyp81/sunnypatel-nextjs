  - question: Are ChatGPT ads live now?
    answer: >-
      Yes. OpenAI began showing ads in ChatGPT on 9 February 2026 for free and
      Go-tier users in the United States. Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and
      Education subscribers will not see ads.
  - question: How much do ChatGPT ads cost?
    answer: >-
      The current beta is enterprise-only at $60 CPM with a $200,000 minimum
      commitment. Self-serve access for smaller advertisers has not yet been
      announced.
  - question: Do ChatGPT ads affect organic AI answers?
    answer: >-
      OpenAI states that ads do not influence what ChatGPT says. Ads appear
      below the organic response as a clearly labelled, visually separated unit.
  - question: How can I appear in ChatGPT organically without paying for ads?
    answer: >-
      By optimising your content for AI citation: structured headings, direct
      answers, factual density, fresh content, and strong entity signals. These
      are the same signals ChatGPT uses to select sources before any ad layer.
