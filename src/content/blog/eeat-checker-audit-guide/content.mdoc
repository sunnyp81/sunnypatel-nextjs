Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines devote over 30 pages to E-E-A-T evaluation. Quality raters assess every page against this framework. While E-E-A-T is not a direct ranking factor, the signals that demonstrate it are deeply embedded in Google's algorithms. This guide provides a practical, step-by-step audit framework you can apply to your own site today.

## What is E-E-A-T and Why Does Google Use It?

E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. Google introduced the original E-A-T framework in 2014 and added the Experience component in December 2022. It defines what high-quality content looks like from Google's perspective.

**Why Google cares about E-E-A-T:** Search quality depends on surfacing content from credible sources. Google's algorithms cannot fact-check every page, but they can evaluate proxy signals — author credentials, site reputation, content depth, external citations — that correlate with quality. E-E-A-T provides the evaluation framework for these signals.

**The practical impact:** Sites demonstrating strong E-E-A-T signals consistently outperform competitors in competitive niches. A Semrush study of 16,000 pages found that sites with comprehensive author bios, citation-supported claims, and established entity signals ranked 22% higher on average than sites with equivalent content but weak E-E-A-T signals.

For a detailed explanation of each pillar, read [what is E-E-A-T in SEO](/blog/what-is-eeat-seo/).

## The E-E-A-T Audit Framework: Overview

This audit evaluates your site across four dimensions, producing an actionable improvement plan. Score each section honestly — the value is in identifying weaknesses, not confirming strengths.

**Scoring system:**

- 0 = Not present
- 1 = Minimal/weak implementation
- 2 = Adequate but improvable
- 3 = Strong implementation

Maximum score: 60 points across 20 audit criteria. Sites scoring below 30 have significant E-E-A-T gaps. Sites scoring 40-50 have solid foundations with room for improvement. Sites scoring 50+ demonstrate strong E-E-A-T compliance.

## Part 1: Experience Audit (15 Points)

Experience evaluates whether content creators have first-hand, direct knowledge of the topics they cover. Google added this pillar because research-aggregated content — accurate but impersonal — fails to serve users seeking genuine insight.

### 1.1 First-Hand Content Signals (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Do blog posts and service pages include specific personal anecdotes or case examples?
- Are client results described with specific metrics (e.g., "increased organic traffic by 180% over 9 months")?
- Do product reviews include evidence the reviewer used the product (original photos, specific usage details)?
- Is there content demonstrating hands-on knowledge that only someone with direct experience would include?

**Score 3 if:** Multiple pages include specific, verifiable first-hand experience with concrete details and measurable outcomes.

**Score 0 if:** All content reads as generic research summaries without personal perspective or specific experience markers.

### 1.2 Case Studies and Portfolio Evidence (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Does the site include detailed case studies with before/after data?
- Are client outcomes specific and measurable rather than vague testimonials?
- Do case studies explain methodology — what was done and why?
- Is there evidence of experience across multiple projects or time periods?

**Score 3 if:** The site presents multiple detailed case studies with verifiable metrics and methodological explanations.

**Score 0 if:** No case studies, portfolio, or project examples exist.

### 1.3 Original Photography and Media (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Are images original (not stock photography)?
- Do product reviews include original product photos?
- Are screenshots from real tools, dashboards, or results used?
- Is video content featuring the actual author/expert available?

**Score 3 if:** Original photography, screenshots, and media consistently demonstrate first-hand involvement.

**Score 0 if:** All images are generic stock photos with no original visual content.

### 1.4 Recency and Currency (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Is content dated and recently updated?
- Do articles reference current data, tools, and practices?
- Are publication and modification dates visible to users?
- Is there evidence of ongoing experience (recent case studies, current client work)?

**Score 3 if:** Content is current, regularly updated, and demonstrates ongoing active experience in the field.

**Score 0 if:** Content is undated or visibly outdated with no recent updates.

### 1.5 User-Generated Experience Signals (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Are there genuine client reviews or testimonials on the site?
- Do reviews include specific project details rather than generic praise?
- Are third-party review platform ratings referenced or embedded?
- Is there evidence of community engagement (comments, forum participation)?

**Score 3 if:** Multiple genuine, detailed reviews from real clients with specific project references.

**Score 0 if:** No reviews, testimonials, or user-generated experience signals exist.

## Part 2: Expertise Audit (15 Points)

Expertise evaluates whether the content creator has the knowledge and skill required to provide accurate, thorough coverage of the topic. Google applies significantly higher expertise standards to YMYL topics.

**Score 3 if:** All content has named authors with detailed, verifiable bios demonstrating topic-specific expertise.

**Score 0 if:** Content has no author attribution or only "Admin" / company name attribution.

**Why this matters:** Google's quality raters specifically check author pages and credentials. A 2024 analysis by Lily Ray found that sites adding comprehensive author bios with verifiable credentials saw average ranking improvements of 12-18% for YMYL content within 3-6 months.

### 2.2 Content Depth and Accuracy (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Does content go beyond surface-level information?
- Are claims supported by citations, data points, or references?
- Is technical information accurate and current?
- Does content demonstrate methodological understanding rather than just topic awareness?

**Score 3 if:** Content consistently demonstrates deep expertise with cited sources, accurate technical detail, and methodological depth.

**Score 0 if:** Content is shallow, generic, or contains factual errors.

### 2.3 Topical Coverage Completeness (0-3)

**What to check:**

- Are related subtopics and questions addressed?
- Does the content architecture demonstrate systematic expertise?
- Is there a logical content hierarchy from broad topics to specific details?

**Score 3 if:** Comprehensive topical coverage with interconnected content demonstrating systematic expertise across the subject area.

**Score 0 if:** Sparse, disconnected content with obvious topic gaps.

Building comprehensive topical coverage is the domain of [topical authority](/services/topical-authority/) and [topical maps](/services/topical-maps/). These services create the content architecture that demonstrates expertise at scale.

## Part 4: Trustworthiness Audit (15 Points)

Trustworthiness is the overarching evaluation — Google's quality guidelines describe it as the most important factor. It encompasses site security, transparency, accuracy, and honest business practices.

### 4.1 Site Security and Technical Trust (0-3)

## YMYL Considerations: When E-E-A-T Standards are Higher

YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) topics face significantly stricter E-E-A-T evaluation. Google applies elevated standards to content that could impact:

- **Financial wellbeing:** Investment advice, tax guidance, loan information
- **Health and safety:** Medical information, drug interactions, emergency guidance
- **Legal matters:** Legal rights, immigration, contractual obligations
- **Major life decisions:** Buying a home, choosing education, insurance

**If your site covers YMYL topics:**

- Author credentials become essential, not optional
- Source citations for every factual claim are expected
- Professional review processes should be documented
- Content must be current — outdated YMYL information is actively harmful
- Trust signals (HTTPS, contact information, editorial policy) must be comprehensive

Sites in YMYL categories scoring below 40 on this audit framework have significant competitive disadvantages.

## How E-E-A-T Connects to Entity SEO

E-E-A-T and entity SEO are deeply interconnected. Entity SEO provides the technical infrastructure that makes E-E-A-T signals machine-readable.

**Experience** is demonstrated through content attributes — case studies, first-hand details, original media — that entity markup makes explicitly discoverable.

**Expertise** is validated through Person and Organisation schema connecting authors to credentials, publications, and professional profiles.

**Authoritativeness** is built through entity relationships — sameAs links, external mentions, and Knowledge Graph presence — that establish your entity's position within its topic space.

**Trustworthiness** is reinforced through consistent entity data across all platforms, transparent business information, and verifiable attributes.

Building strong E-E-A-T without entity SEO is like having excellent credentials but never putting them on your CV. The signals exist but remain invisible to the systems evaluating you. A comprehensive [semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) approach ensures E-E-A-T signals are communicated through every available channel.

## Tools for Checking E-E-A-T Signals

No single tool provides a comprehensive E-E-A-T score — Google does not publish one. However, these tools evaluate specific E-E-A-T components.

**Google Search Console** — Monitor search performance, structured data validation, and manual action notices. Manual actions directly indicate trustworthiness failures.

**Google Rich Results Test** — Validates structured data implementation supporting expertise and entity signals.

**Screaming Frog SEO Spider** — Crawl your site to identify missing author bios, thin About pages, missing schema markup, and structural issues affecting E-E-A-T presentation.

**Ahrefs/Semrush** — Evaluate backlink profile quality (authoritativeness), brand mentions, and referring domain authority.

**Schema.org Validator** — Verify that Person, Organisation, and Article schema are correctly implemented.

**Google Alerts** — Monitor brand mentions and citations across the web for authoritativeness tracking.

**Manual review** — The most effective E-E-A-T assessment remains a human review following Google's own Search Quality Rater Guidelines. My [technical SEO audit](/services/technical-seo-audit/) includes this comprehensive E-E-A-T review.

## Step-by-Step Action Plan After Your Audit

Once you have completed the scoring, prioritise improvements based on impact and feasibility.

**Immediate actions (Week 1-2):**

- Add author bios with credentials to all content pages
- Update your About page with comprehensive entity information
- Ensure HTTPS, privacy policy, and contact information are complete
- Implement Organisation and Person schema markup

**Short-term improvements (Month 1-2):**

- Add source citations to all factual claims
- Create or update case studies with specific metrics
- Implement Article schema linking content to authors
- Audit and correct NAP consistency across all platforms

**Medium-term development (Month 2-6):**

- Build comprehensive topical coverage through systematic content creation

- Develop original media (photos, videos, data visualisations)
- Build backlinks from authoritative, topically relevant sources

**Long-term authority building (Month 6+):**

- Pursue industry awards, certifications, and speaking opportunities
- Develop original research and data others cite
- Build Knowledge Panel presence through consistent entity signals
- Expand [topical authority](/blog/how-to-build-topical-authority/) through comprehensive content programmes

## Common E-E-A-T Audit Mistakes

**Focusing on individual pages instead of entity-level signals.** E-E-A-T operates at the entity level — your overall site and author reputation — not just individual pages. Improving one page's E-E-A-T without addressing site-wide signals produces minimal impact.

**Adding fake or purchased reviews.** Google's algorithms are sophisticated at detecting manufactured reviews. Fake reviews damage trustworthiness rather than building it. Genuine reviews from real clients are the only acceptable approach.

**Treating E-E-A-T as a one-time project.** E-E-A-T signals need continuous reinforcement. Publishing stops, outdated content, and stale credentials erode signals over time. Build E-E-A-T maintenance into your ongoing SEO workflow.

**Ignoring structured data.** E-E-A-T signals that exist only in natural language content are harder for algorithms to evaluate than signals communicated through structured data. Schema markup transforms implicit signals into explicit, machine-readable declarations.
