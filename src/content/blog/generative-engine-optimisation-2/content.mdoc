Traditional SEO optimises for blue links. GEO optimises for AI citations.

## What is Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)?

The practice of structuring content so that AI language models select it as a source when generating answers. Traditional SEO earns ranking position; GEO earns citation inside the AI's response.

## How Does GEO Differ from Traditional SEO?

Traditional SEO optimises for ranking signals: backlinks, keyword relevance, technical performance. GEO optimises for citation signals: factual precision, source credibility, answer completeness, structured formatting.

## Why Does GEO Matter in 2026?

AI search handles an estimated 15-25% of queries with growing share. Some content generates 57 AI citations for every 1 organic click across a 44-site portfolio.

## What Content Gets Cited by AI Models?

Factual precision, direct question answering, structured formatting, entity credibility, and comprehensive topic coverage.

## How Do You Start Implementing GEO?

Audit answer completeness, add structured definitions, include verifiable data, build entity authority, and track AI citations via Bing Webmaster Tools.

## Does GEO Replace Traditional SEO?

GEO extends SEO -- it does not replace it. Pages need to rank to enter the AI's consideration set. Earn both the ranking and the citation.
