A Google algorithm update drops your traffic by 40% overnight. Acting immediately — changing everything, publishing more content, building more links — is exactly the wrong approach. Effective algorithm recovery starts with diagnosis, not action.

## What is a Google Algorithm Update?

**What is a Google algorithm update?** A Google algorithm update is a change to the systems Google uses to rank search results. Google makes thousands of small updates annually. Several major "core updates" each year cause significant ranking shifts across many sites. Core updates don't target individual sites. They change how Google evaluates quality signals across the web. Some sites rise. Others fall.

## Step 1 — Confirm the Drop is Update-Related

Not every traffic drop is caused by an algorithm update. Before assuming an update is responsible, verify three things.

Check [Google's confirmed update history](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/ranking) to see if a major update coincided with your traffic drop date. Cross-reference the drop in Google Search Console — did impressions drop (a rankings issue) or just clicks (a CTR issue)? Check for technical issues: crawl errors, accidental noindex tags, or a broken sitemap can cause traffic drops that look like algorithm impacts but have nothing to do with Google's ranking systems.

## Step 2 — Identify What Fell and Why

Export your keyword ranking data from the period surrounding the drop. Identify which pages lost rankings and which queries they lost rankings for. Look for patterns across the losses.

**Rankings lost primarily for informational queries** often indicate content quality issues. Google updated its evaluation of depth, accuracy, or E-E-A-T signals in your content.

**Rankings lost for commercial or transactional queries** may indicate intent mismatch. Your pages may no longer match what Google understands the searcher wants to find.

**Rankings lost in a specific content category whilst others held** points to topical-specific quality issues rather than a site-wide problem.

## Step 3 — Audit the Content That Fell

Run an honest quality assessment for each significant page that lost rankings.

**Does it demonstrate genuine expertise?** Google's core updates consistently reward content demonstrating first-hand experience and deep subject knowledge. Thin content assembled from secondary sources loses ground to original, expert-led content.

**Does it comprehensively answer the query?** Compare your page against what currently ranks after the update. Competitors now ranking with longer, more comprehensive content covering questions yours doesn't address signal the gap to close.

**Is the E-E-A-T signal clear?** Identify who wrote it. Confirm their credentials are evident on the page. Check that the content includes specific, verifiable claims rather than vague generalisations.

## Step 4 — Check Your Topical Coverage

Core updates frequently reward sites building genuine [topical authority](/services/topical-authority/) whilst penalising sites ranking for isolated queries without comprehensive topic coverage. Strong pages on some aspects of a topic combined with significant gaps elsewhere can trigger this signal inconsistency.

Map your current content against a complete [topical map](/services/topical-maps/) of your subject area. Identify which subtopics are covered well, which are covered thinly, and which have no coverage. The recovery plan should prioritise closing the most significant coverage gaps first.

## Step 5 — Improve Before You Scale

The most common recovery mistake: publishing new content before improving existing content. Google already has data on your existing pages. Publishing more content of the same quality won't change its evaluation.

Update, expand, and strengthen the pages that fell before creating new ones. Add depth to thin articles. Add first-hand experience signals to generic content. Improve the heading structure and semantic coverage of pages close to ranking but not quite there.

## What Doesn't Work for Algorithm Recovery

These tactics reliably don't work: mass content deletion (removing thin content sounds logical but often removes pages providing coverage signals); aggressive link building immediately after a drop (Google is evaluating quality — not rewarding link volume); reverting to a backup from before the update (the content that existed then isn't why you're recovering).

Genuine content quality improvement is the only reliable recovery mechanism.

## How Long Does Recovery Take?

Algorithm recovery is confirmed at the next major update — typically 3–6 months after Google's core updates are released. There are no shortcuts. Sites genuinely improving content quality recover at the next update. Sites that don't remain suppressed until they do.
