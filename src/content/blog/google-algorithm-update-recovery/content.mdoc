## What is a Google Algorithm Update?

A Google algorithm update represents a change to ranking systems. Major "core updates" produce significant ranking shifts modifying quality signal evaluation across the web rather than targeting individual sites.

## Step 1 -- Confirm the Drop is Update-Related

Not every traffic decline stems from algorithm updates. Verify: Check Google's official update history against your traffic drop timing. Review Google Search Console data. Investigate technical problems.

## Step 2 -- Identify What Fell and Why

Export ranking data. Identify affected pages and queries looking for patterns. Informational losses suggest content quality issues. Commercial losses indicate intent mismatches. Category-specific losses point to topical problems.

## Step 3 -- Audit the Content That Fell

Does content demonstrate genuine expertise? Compare pages against current top-ranking competitors. Verify E-E-A-T signals are clear.

## Step 4 -- Check Your Topical Coverage

Core updates reward sites building topical authority while penalizing isolated rankings. Map content against complete topical frameworks, identifying well-covered, thin, and missing subtopics.

## Step 5 -- Improve Before You Scale

The critical mistake involves publishing new content before strengthening existing pages. Update and expand fallen pages before creating new ones.

## What Doesn't Work for Algorithm Recovery

Mass content deletion, aggressive post-drop link building, reverting to pre-update backups. Genuine quality improvement remains the sole reliable recovery mechanism.

## How Long Does Recovery Take?

Recovery confirms at the next major update -- typically 3-6 months after core updates.
