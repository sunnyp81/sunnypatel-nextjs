"How many keywords should my website target?" represents flawed strategy.

## The Flawed Keyword Count Approach

Targeting arbitrary keyword quantities generates disconnected content lacking cohesion.

## What Keywords Should I Use? The Right Question

Ask: "What topics demonstrate industry expertise?" Target query networks rather than isolated terms.

## The Topical Authority Approach

Define central entity, identify core topics, map supporting queries, cover comprehensively. Numbers emerge from comprehensive coverage, not preset targets.

## How Many Keywords Can One Page Target?

One primary keyword plus related semantic variations. Stop creating multiple pages targeting slight keyword variations.

## Practical Keyword Strategy

Small local businesses: 30-60 keywords. Professional services: 80-150. E-commerce: 200-1000+. Enterprise: 1000+. These are natural outcomes, not targets.

## How to Choose Keywords Strategically

Analyse search intent, check search volume realistically, assess competition honestly, map to business goals.

## Common Keyword Mistakes

Targeting unrankable keywords, keyword stuffing, ignoring intent, creating thin content.

## What About Long-Tail Keywords?

Often convert better despite lower volume. Target through comprehensive coverage, not dedicated pages.

## Stop Counting, Start Covering

A site ranking for 50 relevant keywords with strong conversions outperforms 500 irrelevant keywords.
