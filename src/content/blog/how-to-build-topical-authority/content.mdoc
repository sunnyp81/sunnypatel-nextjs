Most SEO campaigns pursue individual keyword rankings. Topical authority campaigns transform this approach. When built correctly, sites rank for hundreds of keywords never explicitly targeted.

## What is Topical Authority and Why Does It Matter?

Topical authority represents the state where search engines recognize a website as the most authoritative resource on a particular subject. Formula: Historical Data x Topical Coverage / Cost of Retrieval.

## Step 1 -- Define Your Topical Scope

Authority requires strategic focus within a defined subject area. Scope should be narrow enough for comprehensive coverage yet broad enough to contain commercial value.

## Step 2 -- Build a Topical Map

A topical map identifies every query target audiences ask, organizing them into clusters. Three levels: root topics, node topics, and seed topics. This identifies 40+ ranking opportunities competitors overlook.

## Step 3 -- Prioritise Content by Cluster

Build one cluster nearly complete before starting another. A site with 15 comprehensive articles on one subtopic demonstrates more authority than 50 shallow articles across 50 subtopics. Publish hub pages first.

## Step 4 -- Write for Comprehensive Coverage

Each article should exhaust its subtopic, addressing every potential reader question and adjacent concerns.

## Step 5 -- Build Your Internal Linking Architecture

Support pages link to hubs; hubs to related hubs; conversion pages receive links from authoritative cluster content. Hub-and-spoke structures organize content around central hub pages.

## Step 6 -- Publish Consistently and Track Progress

Two quality articles weekly for six months demonstrates significantly more authority than ten articles in bursts. Track through keyword ranking reports, impressions growth, and topical map completion percentage.

## How Long Does Building Topical Authority Take?

- Low-competition niches: 3-6 months
- Medium competition: 6-12 months
- High competition: 12-24 months

Clients following this methodology achieve 150-280% traffic growth within 6-9 months.
