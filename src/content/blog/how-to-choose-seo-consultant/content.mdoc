The SEO industry has no formal regulation. Anyone can call themselves an SEO consultant, charge significant fees, and deliver nothing measurable. Legitimate SEO looks different from what most agencies sell. Here are the 7 questions to ask before signing anything.

## Question 1: Can You Show Me Examples of Rankings You've Actually Delivered?

Any consultant worth hiring can show verifiable examples of ranking improvements for previous clients. Ask for Google Search Console screenshots showing before/after traffic data — not rank tracker graphs, which can be manipulated or cherry-picked.

Legitimate consultants show you the data. They explain what they did, what changed, and how long it took. Understanding [how to be an SEO](/blog/how-to-be-an-seo/) helps you evaluate whether a consultant has the depth of experience their portfolio claims. Consultants deflecting this question with NDAs, vague references to "great results", or case studies without numbers are a warning sign.

## Question 2: What is Your Core SEO Methodology?

A consultant without a clear, explainable methodology is guessing. The methodology doesn't need to be proprietary — it needs to be coherent. Can they explain how they identify keyword opportunities? How they prioritise on-page versus technical work? How they decide what content to create?

The right answer involves a systematic process: keyword and competitor research, [topical mapping](/services/topical-maps/), technical audit, content strategy, and measurement. Understanding [how to build topical authority](/blog/how-to-build-topical-authority/) is a methodology marker that separates strategic consultants from checkbox operators. "We do everything" without specifics means keep looking.

## Question 3: How Do You Report on Progress and What Metrics Do You Track?

Ask to see an example monthly report from a current client (anonymised). It should show keyword ranking movements across all tracked terms, organic traffic data from Google Search Console, and progress against agreed goals — not vanity metrics like "domain authority improved."

A good consultant measures what matters to your business: enquiry volume, revenue-generating keyword rankings, and qualified traffic growth. Reporting on metrics you can't connect to revenue means optimising for looking good rather than delivering results.

## Question 4: Do You Follow Google's Webmaster Guidelines?

This question separates white-hat from grey or black-hat practitioners. Google's Webmaster Guidelines describe acceptable SEO practices. Tactics violating them — private blog networks, link schemes, keyword stuffing, cloaking — can produce short-term gains followed by manual penalties that tank your rankings.

A legitimate consultant will answer this confidently. They will explain specifically what they don't do and why. Any hesitation or redirection ("all SEO involves some risk") warrants further scrutiny.

## Question 5: What Deliverables Will I Own?

Every strategy document, topical map, content brief, and technical audit your consultant produces should be yours — not held hostage to a retainer relationship. Some agencies retain ownership of all deliverables, meaning you lose everything if you change provider.

Ask explicitly: "If I cancel the contract in three months, what do I own?" The answer should be: everything produced during the engagement. I give every client full documentation of their topical map, content briefs, and strategy. You own your deliverables regardless of how long we work together.

## Question 6: What Results Can I Realistically Expect and Over What Timeline?

Anyone promising page 1 rankings in 30 days or guaranteed position 1 results is either lying or planning to use tactics that will ultimately harm your site. Legitimate SEO timelines are:

Technical fixes and on-page improvements: 4–8 weeks to see measurable changes. Content strategy implementation: 3–6 months for initial ranking improvements. Topical authority and sustainable competitive advantage: 6–18 months depending on competition and starting position.

Clients following my methodology see meaningful traffic improvements within 6–9 months of campaign launch. Traffic increases of 150–280% are common in less competitive niches. High competition markets require 12–18 months to reach dominant positions.

## Question 7: Have You Worked With Businesses Like Mine?

SEO varies significantly between industries. An e-commerce SEO specialist may not understand the content strategy requirements for a professional services firm. A national brand specialist may not understand the Google Business Profile nuances of local SEO.

Ask specifically about experience in your sector, your business size, and your geographic market. Local Berkshire businesses benefit from a consultant who understands the Thames Valley competitive landscape — not just national ranking theory.

## Red Flags to Avoid

These are immediate warning signs: guaranteed rankings promises; prices dramatically below market rate (quality SEO is not cheap — see [how much does SEO cost](/services/how-much-does-seo-cost-fixed-price-vs-retainers/) for realistic benchmarks); no clear explanation of what's included in the monthly retainer; contracts requiring 12+ months commitment without performance milestones; no access to your own Google Analytics or Search Console data.
