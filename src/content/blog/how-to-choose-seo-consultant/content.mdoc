The SEO industry has no formal regulation. Anyone can call themselves an SEO consultant. Here are the 7 questions to ask before signing anything.

## Question 1: Can You Show Me Examples of Rankings You've Actually Delivered?

Ask for Google Search Console screenshots showing before/after traffic data -- not rank tracker graphs. Legitimate consultants show the data and explain what they did.

## Question 2: What is Your Core SEO Methodology?

A consultant without a clear, explainable methodology is guessing. The right answer involves a systematic process: keyword and competitor research, topical mapping, technical audit, content strategy, and measurement.

## Question 3: How Do You Report on Progress and What Metrics Do You Track?

Reports should show keyword ranking movements, organic traffic from GSC, and progress against agreed goals -- not vanity metrics like domain authority.

## Question 4: Do You Follow Google's Webmaster Guidelines?

This separates white-hat from grey or black-hat practitioners. Tactics violating guidelines can produce short-term gains followed by manual penalties.

## Question 5: What Deliverables Will I Own?

Every strategy document, topical map, content brief, and audit should be yours. All deliverables owned regardless of engagement length.

## Question 6: What Results Can I Realistically Expect and Over What Timeline?

Technical fixes: 4-8 weeks. Content strategy: 3-6 months. Topical authority: 6-18 months. Clients following methodology see 150-280% traffic improvements within 6-9 months.

## Question 7: Have You Worked With Businesses Like Mine?

Ask about experience in your sector, business size, and geographic market.

## Red Flags to Avoid

Guaranteed rankings promises, prices dramatically below market rate, no clear explanation of retainer, 12+ month contracts without milestones, no access to your own data.
