## Why Organic Traffic Plateaus

Limited topical coverage, technical limitations, or content quality ceiling.

## The Strategic Framework

Audit current performance, map expansion opportunities, prioritise by business value.

## Method 1: Optimise Existing Pages

Quick wins in Search Console, improve titles and metadata, add semantic completeness, strengthen internal linking. One properly optimised page captures 20-40 additional keyword variations.

## Method 2: Fill Content Gaps

Competitor gap analysis, create strategic content with hub pages and spoke pages.

## Method 3: Improve Technical Foundation

Fix crawl issues, improve Core Web Vitals, enhance mobile experience.

## Method 4: Build Strategic Links

Prioritise relevant link sources, create linkable assets.

## Method 5: Systematic Content Publication

1 comprehensive hub/service page monthly (2000+ words), 2-3 supporting spoke pages weekly (800-1200 words), update 1-2 existing pages monthly.

## Realistic Growth Timelines

Months 1-3: 15-30% increase. Months 3-6: 40-80% increase. Months 6-12: 100-200% increase.

## What Not to Do

Keyword stuffing, buying links, thin content, copying competitors, targeting misaligned keywords.
