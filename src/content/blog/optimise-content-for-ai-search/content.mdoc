AI search is now the default experience for millions of queries. Bing Copilot, ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews generate answers from your content. Optimising means getting cited in those answers.

## What Does Optimising for AI Search Mean?

Structuring content so that large language models select it as a source. Prioritises direct answerability, factual precision, and entity credibility over keyword density.

## Why Traditional SEO Is Not Enough for AI Search

A page at position 6 with a clear structured answer frequently outperforms position 1 with narrative-heavy content.

## 7 Content Patterns That Earn AI Citations

1. **Answer First, Context Second** -- inverted pyramid format
2. **Explicit Question-Answer Formatting** -- bolded question followed by definition sentence
3. **Include Specific Data Points** -- "150-280% within 6-9 months" not "most businesses improve"
4. **Cover Related Questions in One Page** -- comprehensive sources preferred
5. **Use Clean HTML Structure** -- clear heading hierarchies, short paragraphs, bulleted lists
6. **Establish Entity Credibility** -- consistent publication, structured data, external mentions
7. **Match Content to the Exact Query** -- dedicated sections answering specific questions

## How to Track AI Search Performance

Bing Webmaster Tools provides Copilot citation data. Google Search Console does not yet provide equivalent data for AI Overviews.
