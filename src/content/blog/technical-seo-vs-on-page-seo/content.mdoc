Technical SEO and on-page SEO both affect rankings but solve different problems. A technically perfect site with weak content won't rank. A content-rich site with fundamental technical failures won't be indexed. Most sites need both.

## What is Technical SEO?

Technical SEO is optimising a website's infrastructure so search engines can efficiently crawl, index, and understand its content. It covers site speed, crawlability, indexation, structured data, URL structure, HTTPS implementation, mobile performance, and Core Web Vitals.

## What is On-Page SEO?

On-page SEO optimises individual pages to communicate topical relevance, intent match, and quality. It covers title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, keyword usage, content depth, internal linking, image alt text, and entity signals.

## What Does Technical SEO Include?

**Crawlability** -- robots.txt, noindex tags, and server configurations. **Indexation management** -- XML sitemaps, duplicate content, canonical tags. **Site speed and Core Web Vitals** -- LCP, INP, CLS. **Structured data** -- schema markup for rich results. **Mobile performance** -- Google indexes the mobile version first.

## What Does On-Page SEO Include?

**Title tags and meta descriptions** -- primary relevance signals and CTR influence. **Heading structure** -- H1, H2, H3 communicate page organization. **Content depth and entity coverage** -- comprehensive pages rank better. **Internal linking** -- distributes ranking signals and communicates content relationships.

## Which Should You Prioritise?

Prioritise technical SEO first -- always. Fixing crawl and indexation issues produces faster improvements. Once the technical foundation is sound, on-page optimization produces compounding returns.
