Newer sites with lower Domain Authority outrank established competitors regularly. The reason is almost always topical authority. DA is a third-party metric. Topical authority is a ranking mechanism. They are not the same thing.

## What is Domain Authority?

Domain Authority is a proprietary score (0-100) created by Moz predicting ranking likelihood based on backlink profile. It is not a Google metric. Google does not use Domain Authority.

## What is Topical Authority?

A ranking state where search engines recognise a website as the most comprehensive, reliable source on a specific subject. It is topic-specific. A site can have dominant topical authority for one topic and minimal authority for another.

## Why Can a Low-DA Site Outrank a High-DA Site?

Google evaluates content relevance and topical expertise at the query level. A DA 25 site with 40 comprehensive articles on one topic will outrank a DA 60 general site with one thin article.

## Does Domain Authority Matter at All?

Backlinks do contribute to rankings, particularly for competitive head terms. The issue is optimising for DA as a primary goal ignores content depth, misses topic gaps, and produces fragile rankings.

## Which Should You Focus On?

Build topical authority first. Add targeted link building to high-value pages once topical authority is established. Authority first, amplification second. Clients see 150-280% traffic increases within 6-9 months through this approach.
