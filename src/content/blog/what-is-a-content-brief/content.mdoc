Most content fails to rank because it was written without a brief. A proper SEO content brief eliminates guesswork.

## What is a Content Brief in SEO?

A content brief is a specification document defining the target keyword, search intent, required structure, entities to include, questions to answer, internal links to use, and competitive gaps to address. It bridges strategy and execution.

## What Does a Good SEO Content Brief Include?

**Primary keyword and intent classification** -- the exact target query and whether the intent is informational, commercial, or transactional.

**SERP analysis** -- breakdown of current top-ranking pages covering heading structure, word count, content types, and specific questions.

**Semantic entities to include** -- related concepts, people, places, and terminology.

**Questions to answer** -- extracted from People Also Ask, competitor headings, and keyword research.

**Heading structure** -- H1, H2, and H3 structure ensuring content hierarchy mirrors SERP's preferred format.

**Internal links to include** -- specific pages with anchor text recommendations.

**Word count target** -- based on SERP analysis, not arbitrary.

## How Does a Content Brief Improve Rankings?

**Semantic coverage** -- ensures comprehensive topical relevance. **Intent alignment** -- ensures content type matches intent. **Consistent quality** -- enables content production at scale.

## Can You Write Good Content Without a Brief?

Experienced SEO writers can, but briefs formalize and externalize the research. They make the process auditable, repeatable, and scalable. Briefs are essential for teams.

## How Much Does a Content Brief Cost?

Content brief service starts from £150 per brief including full SERP analysis, semantic entity mapping, heading structure, question extraction, and internal linking specifications.
