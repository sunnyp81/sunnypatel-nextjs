Google understands entities -- not just pages. Businesses, people, places, and concepts exist in Google's Knowledge Graph with distinct attributes, relationships, and authority levels.

## What is Entity SEO?

Entity SEO optimizes how search engines perceive and classify your brand, business, or personal identity. It builds a clear, consistent entity profile that earns topical authority and appears in AI-generated responses.

## Why Does Entity SEO Matter?

Google's E-E-A-T framework prioritizes understanding "who" publishes content before evaluating "what." Entity credibility proves especially critical for AI search. Bing Copilot and ChatGPT Search favor entities with established credibility signals.

## What Makes a Strong Entity in Google's Eyes?

**Entity consistency** -- same name, location, descriptors across all platforms.

**Entity attributes** -- specific, verifiable facts: years of experience, qualifications, location, services.

**Entity relationships** -- connections to other recognized entities.

**Topical entity authority** -- high-quality content within a defined topic area consistently.

## How Do You Build Entity SEO?

Implement structured data markup. Optimize your About page. Maintain consistent NAP data. Claim your Knowledge Panel. Publish content reinforcing expertise.

## What is the Difference Between Entity SEO and Keyword SEO?

Keyword SEO optimizes individual pages. Entity SEO optimizes your overall digital presence so all content carries inherent authority. Combine both for best results.

## How Long Does Entity Building Take?

6-18 months of consistent effort. Structured data processes within weeks. Knowledge Graph inclusion requires 3-6 months. Full entity authority requires 12+ months.
