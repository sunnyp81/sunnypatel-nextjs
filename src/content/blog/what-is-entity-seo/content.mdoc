Google does not just rank pages — it understands entities. Businesses, people, places, and concepts exist in Google's Knowledge Graph as distinct entities with attributes, relationships, and authority levels. Entity SEO is the practice of establishing and strengthening your entity so search engines understand exactly what you are and why you're relevant.

## What is Entity SEO?

**What is entity SEO?** Entity SEO is the practice of optimising how search engines perceive and classify your brand, business, or personal identity. It builds a clear, consistent entity profile that earns [topical authority](/blog/how-to-build-topical-authority/) and appears in AI-generated responses. It moves beyond keyword targeting. It establishes _who you are_ as the foundation for _what you rank for_.

Traditional SEO asks: what keywords should this page target? Entity SEO asks: what entity does this page belong to, what attributes define that entity, and what relationship does this content have to the entity's overall authority?

## Why Does Entity SEO Matter?

Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines and the [E-E-A-T framework](/blog/what-is-eeat-seo/) both prioritise understanding _who_ is publishing content before evaluating _what_ the content says. A medical advice article from a verified doctor entity carries more weight than the same article from an anonymous website — regardless of keyword optimisation. Google's Knowledge Graph contains over 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. When your brand becomes a recognised entity within this graph, ranking becomes a function of relevance rather than link count.

Entity credibility is even more critical for AI search. Bing Copilot and ChatGPT Search prefer entities with established credibility signals — recognised expertise, consistent publication history, and verifiable attributes. Weak entity signals mean being overlooked in AI-generated answers regardless of content quality.

## What Makes a Strong Entity in Google's Eyes?

Google evaluates entities across several dimensions. Understand each one before building your strategy.

**Entity consistency** — use the same name, location, and descriptors consistently across your website, Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, schema markup, and external mentions. Inconsistent entity signals confuse the Knowledge Graph and dilute authority.

**Entity attributes** — include specific, verifiable facts: years of experience, qualifications, location, services offered, and industries served. Search engines extract these from your content and structured data to classify your entity accurately.

**Entity relationships** — build connections to other recognised entities. Mentions on established industry sites, citations by authoritative publications, and links from entities Google already recognises all strengthen your entity profile.

**Topical entity authority** — publish high-quality content within a defined topic area consistently. This signals that your entity is an authority on that subject. This is the foundation of [topical authority](/services/topical-authority/). Comprehensive content coverage matters beyond individual keyword rankings.

## How Do You Build Entity SEO?

Build a strong entity profile through consistent action across several areas.

**Implement structured data markup.** Add Organisation, Person, LocalBusiness, or appropriate schema markup to your website. This provides machine-readable entity attributes that search engines use to populate the Knowledge Graph. Include your name, address, founding date, services, and social profiles.

**Optimise your About page.** Your About page is the primary entity definition document on your site. State clearly who you are, what you do, your credentials, your location, and your area of expertise. Thin or placeholder About pages undermine entity signals significantly.

**Maintain consistent NAP data.** Name, Address, and Phone number must match exactly across your website, Google Business Profile, directory listings, and social profiles. Even minor variations (Street vs St, Ltd vs Limited) create entity ambiguity and reduce Knowledge Graph confidence.

**Claim your Knowledge Panel.** Verify and update your Knowledge Panel in Google Search. Add accurate attributes, a verified description, and your official social profiles. A verified Knowledge Panel significantly strengthens entity signals across your entire domain.

**Publish content reinforcing your expertise.** My [topical map service](/services/topical-maps/) identifies the full query space your entity should own. It creates the content architecture that demonstrates comprehensive expertise to Google's entity evaluation systems. In my own consulting practice, implementing entity consolidation — structured Person schema, consistent NAP data, and sameAs linking across LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, and industry directories — improved brand query visibility within 6-8 weeks.

## What is the Difference Between Entity SEO and Keyword SEO?

**Entity SEO vs keyword SEO:** Keyword SEO optimises individual pages to rank for specific search terms. Entity SEO optimises your overall digital presence so that all content from your entity carries inherent authority. Strong entity signals raise the baseline ranking performance of your entire site — not just individual pages.

Combine both for best results. Build entity authority through consistent, comprehensive content. Ensure each page is optimised for its specific target queries.

## How Long Does Entity Building Take?

Entity authority builds incrementally over 6–18 months of consistent effort. Structured data is processed within weeks of implementation. Knowledge Graph inclusion and topical entity recognition take 3–6 months of consistent, quality publication. Full entity authority providing measurable ranking benefits typically requires 12+ months.

Entity signals compound over time. Signals built today continue strengthening your rankings for years. They cannot be matched by competitors in weeks the way individual keyword optimisations can.

I review entity signals as part of every [technical SEO audit](/services/technical-seo-audit/) and [semantic SEO strategy](/services/semantic-seo/).
