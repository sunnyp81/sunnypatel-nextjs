Someone asks ChatGPT which SEO consultant to hire in Reading. Your website either gets mentioned or it doesn't. Bing Copilot explains what topical authority is. It cites your content or a competitor's. LLM optimisation is the practice of ensuring it's yours. It is happening now. Most businesses have no strategy for it.

## What is LLM Optimisation?

LLM optimisation (Large Language Model optimisation) involves structuring content, building entity authority, and establishing digital presence to increase the likelihood of AI systems selecting your content. It applies across ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, Google Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and similar platforms.

## How Do LLMs Decide What to Include in Their Answers?

LLMs generate answers through two mechanisms: training data and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG retrieves content in real time, prioritizing findable, trustworthy, and clearly structured information.

## How Does LLM Optimisation Differ from Traditional SEO?

Traditional SEO optimizes for ranking positions; LLM optimization targets citation selection. Key differences include answer directness, entity recognition, and source credibility.

## What Makes Content LLM-Ready?

Factual precision with specific data points, direct question-answer structure, comprehensive topic coverage, and clean technical implementation.

## How Do You Track LLM Visibility?

Bing Webmaster Tools provides Copilot citation data. Manual testing across ChatGPT and Perplexity reveals platform-specific citation patterns.

## Is LLM Optimisation Worth Investing In Now?

AI search currently handles 15-25% of queries with growing adoption. Early investment establishes entity recognition before competitors.
