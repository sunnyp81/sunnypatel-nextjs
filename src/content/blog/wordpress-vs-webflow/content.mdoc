**WordPress** is a CMS requiring separate hosting. Complete control but must manage technical details.

**Webflow** is an integrated platform. Simpler but less flexible for complex requirements.

Neither provides inherent ranking advantages. SEO outcomes depend on execution.

## SEO Capabilities Comparison

WordPress: Complete technical control, comprehensive SEO plugins, custom schema markup.

Webflow: Clean code by default, fast loading, integrated SEO configurations.

## Technical SEO Considerations

Page speed: Webflow faster by default, WordPress needs tuning. Both achieve excellent Core Web Vitals. Both support responsive design and comprehensive schema.

## Content Management Comparison

WordPress: Unlimited custom post types, complex fields, batch editing, strong import/export. Better for content-heavy sites.

Webflow: Visual composition, no plugin conflicts, streamlined publishing. Better for design-centric sites.

## Development and Maintenance Costs

3-year total: Basic WordPress £1,000-3,000, Basic Webflow £500-1,500. Complex WordPress £5,000-20,000+, Complex Webflow £2,000-8,000.

## Which Platform for SEO-Focused Businesses?

Choose WordPress for complete control, extensive content, complex functionality. Choose Webflow for design management, swift implementation, simpler sites.
