### What does an SEO consultant do?

An SEO consultant analyses your website, identifies opportunities for improvement, and develops strategies to increase your organic search visibility. This includes technical audits, keyword research, content strategy, and ongoing optimisation to help you rank higher and attract more qualified traffic.  

### How long does it take for me to see SEO results once implemented?  

SEO is a long-term investment. Most clients start seeing measurable improvements within 3-6 months, with significant results typically appearing between 6-12 months. The timeline depends on factors like your current site health, competition level, and the scope of optimisation work required.  

### What SEO services do you offer?  

I offer comprehensive SEO services including technical SEO audits, keyword research, semantic SEO optimisation, local SEO, content strategy, link building, and ongoing SEO consulting. Each service is tailored to your specific business goals and market conditions.  

### What is semantic SEO?  

Semantic SEO focuses on understanding and optimising for the meaning behind search queries, not just keywords. It involves building topical authority through entity-based content networks, helping search engines understand your expertise and relevance within your niche.  

### Do you provide ranking drop analysis and improvements?  

Yes, I specialise in diagnosing and recovering from ranking drops. This includes analysing algorithm updates, technical issues, competitor movements, and content quality factors. I provide a detailed action plan to recover and strengthen your positions.
