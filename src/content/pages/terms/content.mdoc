4. Blog and Educational Content

The blog articles, guides, and resources published on this Website are provided
for general informational and educational purposes only. They represent my personal
opinions and professional experience.

5. Services and Consulting Engagements

5.1 Enquiries
Submitting a contact form or requesting a quote does not create a contractual
relationship. A formal engagement is established only when both parties have agreed
to written terms of service (such as a consulting agreement or statement of work).

5.2 No Guarantee of Results
SEO and digital marketing results depend on many factors outside my control,
including search engine algorithm changes, website technical conditions, market
competition, and client implementation. Nothing on this Website constitutes a
guarantee of specific rankings, traffic levels, or revenue outcomes.

which governs deliverables, payment, confidentiality, and liability. In the event
of conflict, the client agreement takes precedence over these Terms.
