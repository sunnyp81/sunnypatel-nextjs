problem: >-
  Aatma Aesthetics had no meaningful online presence. Their existing site was
  outdated, not mobile-friendly, and generating almost zero organic traffic or
  enquiries. They were relying entirely on word-of-mouth and paid advertising to
  bring in new clients.
solution: >-
  A complete digital rebuild — from scratch. Modern, fast website built with
  conversion in mind: clear service pages, trust signals, Google review
  integration, and structured data. Paired with a semantic SEO strategy targeting
  high-intent local terms across aesthetics treatments.
result: >-
  Within 6 months the site was ranking on page one for competitive local terms.
  Organic clicks increased significantly year-on-year, and the client reduced
  reliance on paid advertising while seeing more qualified enquiry volume.

  The SEO work delivered real results — I'm seeing more clicks compared to this
  time last year in Google Analytics, without having to spend loads on
  advertising. Super impressed.
