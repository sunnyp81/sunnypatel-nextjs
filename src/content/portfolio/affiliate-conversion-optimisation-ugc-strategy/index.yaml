problem: >-
  Affiliate review sites live or die on two metrics — click-through rate and
  conversion rate. Across the portfolio, most sites sat at the industry average
  of 1.17 percent conversion with CTRs below 1 percent on Google. Generic
  product roundups were failing to differentiate from thousands of identical
  competitor pages.
solution: >-
  Deployed a UGC-first content strategy — integrating real user quotes from
  forums, social proof from verified buyers, and community-sourced comparison
  data into affiliate review pages. Combined with a semantic SEO audit that
  pushed content scores from 60 to 92 out of 100, restructuring articles around
  the answer patterns Google and Bing actually reward.
result: >-
  Peak affiliate conversion rate hit 6.51 percent on an optimised pet products
  site — over 5x the portfolio average. A health and fitness site achieved
  25.72 percent CTR on Bing through title optimisation. The UGC water softener
  deployment projected an 18–45x traffic increase on a single page, with
  semantic scores jumping from 60 to 92.
