problem: >-
  Traditional SEO targets ten blue links. But AI-powered search is rewriting the
  rules — Bing Copilot, Google AI Overviews, and ChatGPT all pull answers
  directly from web content. Most publishers have no visibility into whether
  their content is being cited by AI, let alone a strategy to optimise for it.
solution: >-
  Analysed AI Copilot citation data across an 11-site portfolio to reverse-
  engineer which content formats, structures, and topics earn the most AI
  references. Mapped citation patterns against organic click data to understand
  the relationship between AI visibility and traditional search performance.
result: >-
  Identified 120,409 AI Copilot citations across the portfolio with a 57-to-1
  citation-to-click ratio. One technology site alone earned 67,305 citations,
  with a single laptop screen size guide generating 31,377 citations — making it
  one of the most AI-referenced pages in its vertical.
