problem: >-
  The dashboard camera and automotive tech accessory market is crowded with
  generic "top 10" listicles, Amazon affiliate spam, and manufacturer-funded
  review sites. Standing out requires genuine expertise and content depth that
  surface-level competitors cannot replicate. The challenge was building
  authority in a niche where consumer trust is critical — drivers need reliable
  recommendations for safety equipment they depend on.
solution: >-
  Developed a structured product review methodology specific to automotive
  technology: video quality comparisons across lighting conditions, night vision
  capability analysis, parking mode features, app connectivity assessments, and
  real-world installation guides for different vehicle types. Supporting content
  covered UK-specific legal requirements, insurance implications, and technical
  explainers that established the site as a genuine expert resource rather than
  another affiliate placeholder.
result: >-
  The site achieved a 10.16% organic click-through rate — indicating that
  search engine users consistently chose this site over competing results. The
  content accumulated nearly 9,000 AI search citations, with product comparison
  and technical specification content being cited by AI assistants when users
  ask about dashboard cameras and automotive accessories. The site drives
  consistent monthly affiliate revenue through high-intent product
  recommendation content.
