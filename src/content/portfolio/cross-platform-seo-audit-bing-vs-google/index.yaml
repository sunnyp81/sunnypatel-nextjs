problem: >-
  Most site owners only check Google Search Console. By ignoring Bing Webmaster
  Tools entirely, they miss half the picture. Across my 45-site portfolio, I had
  no visibility into Bing performance, AI citation volume, or cross-platform
  ranking discrepancies — meaning revenue was leaking silently.
solution: >-
  Conducted a full cross-platform audit across 11 sites using Bing Webmaster
  Tools data alongside 16 months of Google Search Console exports. Compared
  click volume, CTR, ranking positions, and AI citation metrics side-by-side to
  identify platform-specific gaps and opportunities.
result: >-
  Discovered a 107x performance gap on one site (906 Bing clicks vs 14 Google
  clicks over comparable periods), identified dangerous 90%+ Bing dependency on
  three key sites, and mapped £810 per year in immediate Google revenue recovery.
  The audit also revealed 120,000+ AI Copilot citations — an entirely new
  traffic channel.
