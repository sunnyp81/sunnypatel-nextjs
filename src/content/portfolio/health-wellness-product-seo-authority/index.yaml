problem: >-
  A health and wellness product review site was struggling to gain traction in a
  highly competitive YMYL niche. Competing against established health publishers
  and large e-commerce platforms, the site had minimal visibility and lacked the
  authority signals needed to rank for health-related product queries.
solution: >-
  Built a research-backed content strategy anchored in scientific studies and
  clinical evidence. Every review page cited peer-reviewed research, creating
  genuine E-E-A-T signals that search engines reward. Combined this with semantic
  SEO methodology — topical maps covering the full buyer journey from "do
  vibration plates work" informational queries through to specific product
  comparisons. Structured data markup reinforced the topical authority signals
  across the entire content network.
result: >-
  The site became a category authority in its niche. Organic CTR reached 25.72%
  — roughly 5x the industry average for product review queries. The site
  accumulated over 24,000 AI search citations, meaning AI assistants consistently
  reference its content when answering health and wellness questions. Affiliate
  conversion rates hit 3.51%, generating consistent monthly revenue from a
  relatively small but highly engaged audience.
