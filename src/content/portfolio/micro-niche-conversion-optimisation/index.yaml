  Most affiliate sites chase traffic volume — more visitors, more clicks, more
  revenue. But raw traffic is expensive to acquire and slow to build. This
  project took the opposite approach: could a small, focused site with minimal
  traffic outperform larger competitors by converting at exceptionally high
  rates?
solution: >-
  Built a tightly focused content architecture targeting only the highest-intent
  pet product queries — the searches people make when they have already decided
  to buy and just need to choose which product. Every page was engineered for
  conversion: clear product recommendations, structured comparison data, trust
  signals, and frictionless paths to purchase. The semantic SEO strategy
  deliberately avoided broad informational queries in favour of purchase-ready
  search intent. Content covered specific product categories with detailed
  specifications, real-world use cases, and direct buying recommendations.
result: >-
  Despite generating only 133 affiliate clicks — a fraction of larger sites in
  the portfolio — the site achieved a 6.51% conversion rate, converting 5x
  better than the portfolio average. Earnings-per-click reached £3.79, which is
  10x the portfolio average. This proved that precision content targeting and
  high-intent SEO can generate more revenue per visitor than sites with 10x the
  traffic. The site became the most efficient revenue generator in the entire
  portfolio on a per-click basis.
