## The Challenge

Most SEO consultants manage a handful of client sites. I wanted to prove that semantic SEO methodology scales — not just across 5 or 10 properties, but across 45 niche websites spanning completely different industries.

The question was simple: **can you build a repeatable system that produces page-one rankings across any vertical?**

Each site needed its own topical map, content pipeline, monetisation strategy, and performance monitoring — without the quality dropping as the portfolio grew.

## The Approach

### Semantic SEO Framework

Every site follows the same foundational process built on Koray Tugberk Gubur's semantic SEO methodology:

1. **Topical Mapping** — ROOT/NODE/SEED structure maps the entire knowledge domain before a single word is written
2. **Semantic Briefs** — Each piece of content gets a brief that replicates SERP-recognised answer patterns
3. **Content Production** — Articles follow micro-semantic rules: comma rule compliance, start-with-answer patterns, and contextual bridge terms
4. **Semantic Audit** — Every piece is scored against algorithmic authorship standards before publishing
5. **Meta Generation** — Title tags and descriptions are optimised for both CTR and semantic relevance

### Tiered Portfolio Management

Not every site deserves equal attention. The portfolio is segmented into three tiers based on live performance data:

- **Tier 1 — Scale** (5 sites, 80% of effort): Proven performers with compound growth potential
- **Tier 2 — Fix** (8 sites, 15% of effort): Sites with fixable bottlenecks holding back performance
- **Tier 3 — Kill** (20+ sites, 5% of effort): Underperformers evaluated for consolidation or exit

### Monetisation Channels

Revenue is diversified across three primary channels:

- **Amazon Associates** — 86% of revenue, deployed on product-focused sites
- **Ezoic Display Ads** — 9% of revenue, deployed on informational content sites
- **Mediavine Premium** — 5% of revenue, reserved for highest-traffic properties

## Key Results

### Portfolio-Wide Performance

The 45-site portfolio generates consistent organic traffic across Google and Bing, with several standout performers:

- **Best conversion site** — 6.51% affiliate conversion rate (5x portfolio average)
- **Best CTR site** — 25.72% Bing click-through rate
- **Best AI visibility** — 67,305 AI citations from a single property
- **Highest earner** — One site producing consistent monthly Amazon Associates revenue as the top performer

### Vertical Diversity

The portfolio spans competitive verticals including:

- **Technology** — Laptop guides, tech troubleshooting
- **Health & Fitness** — Vibration plates, fitness equipment
- **Home & Garden** — Mowers, power tools, home appliances
- **Pets** — Pet products, care guides
- **Outdoor** — Binoculars, camping gear
- **Kitchen** — Cookware, food preparation

### What I Learned

Scaling to 45 sites confirmed three things:

1. **Semantic SEO methodology is vertical-agnostic** — the same framework works in tech, health, pets, and home improvement
2. **Tiered management is essential** — trying to grow all sites equally is the fastest way to grow none of them
3. **Conversion rate matters more than traffic** — a site with 133 monthly clicks and 6.51% conversion outearns sites with 10x the traffic
