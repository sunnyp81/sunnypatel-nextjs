problem: >-
  Building a single niche site is straightforward. Scaling SEO operations across
  45 websites — each in a different vertical, with different keyword landscapes
  and monetisation models — requires a repeatable system. Without one, quality
  drops, rankings stall, and revenue flatlines.
solution: >-
  Developed a systematic semantic SEO framework based on Koray Tugberk Gubur's
  methodology. Each site follows the same topical mapping, content production,
  and audit pipeline. Custom tooling automates briefs, audits, and meta
  generation. Sites are segmented into tiers (Scale, Fix, Kill) based on
  performance data to focus effort where it compounds.
result: >-
  45 active sites generating 16,949 monthly affiliate clicks with a portfolio
  conversion rate of 1.17% — rising to 6.51% on optimised sites. Revenue
  channels span Amazon Associates, Ezoic, and Mediavine across verticals
  including tech, health, home, pets, and outdoor.
