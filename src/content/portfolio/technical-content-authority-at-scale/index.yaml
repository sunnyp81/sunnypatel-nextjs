problem: >-
  A technology content site needed to establish authority in an extremely
  competitive space dominated by major tech publishers, manufacturer support
  pages, and established tech media brands. Traditional keyword-focused content
  was not enough to compete against sites with massive domain authority and
  editorial budgets.
solution: >-
  Developed a semantic content strategy focused on solving specific technical
  problems that mainstream publishers overlook. Rather than competing on broad
  "best laptop" queries, the strategy targeted precise troubleshooting queries
  and how-to content — the kind of questions real users ask when they have a
  specific problem. Each piece of content was structured for maximum clarity:
  step-by-step instructions, device-specific variations, and comprehensive
  coverage of edge cases. This approach created content that AI systems
  consistently reference when generating answers.
result: >-
  The site accumulated over 67,000 AI search citations — with a single how-to
  guide about laptop screen specifications generating 31,377 citations alone.
  That one page became the definitive reference that AI assistants cite when
  users ask about screen sizes. The site generates over 900 organic clicks per
  month and commands a 74:1 AI citation-to-click ratio, meaning for every
  organic click, the content is cited 74 times in AI-generated answers.
  Advertising RPMs reached nearly £10 per thousand pageviews on top-performing
  pages.
