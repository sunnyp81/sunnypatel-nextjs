## The Platform

TheTutorLink is an online tutoring marketplace that connects students with qualified tutors across subjects and levels. The platform operates across two domains:

- **thetutor.link** — the marketing and informational site
- **app.thetutor.link** — the web application where tutors create profiles and students book sessions

Both domains needed organic visibility, but they served fundamentally different purposes and required different SEO strategies.

## The Challenge

EdTech is one of the most competitive organic search verticals. Established players like Tutorful, MyTutor, and Superprof dominate the SERPs with significant domain authority and content depth.

For a newer platform, the challenge was clear:

- Near-zero organic visibility on both domains
- No structured data implementation for tutor profiles
- Marketing site lacked content targeting high-intent tutoring keywords
- Web application pages weren't optimised for indexation or search visibility
- No cross-platform SEO strategy connecting the marketing site to the application

## The Dual-Domain Strategy

### Marketing Site — thetutor.link

The marketing site needed to capture informational and transactional search intent:

- **Subject landing pages** — optimised pages for "online maths tutor", "GCSE science tutoring", and similar high-intent queries
- **Content strategy** — educational content targeting parents and students searching for tutoring guidance
- **Trust signals** — tutor credentials, success stories, and platform differentiators
- **Technical SEO** — structured data, sitemap submission, and crawl optimisation

### Web Application — app.thetutor.link

The application required a different approach focused on indexable tutor profiles:

- **Profile page SEO** — ensuring tutor profiles were indexable with unique, descriptive content
- **Subject category pages** — creating crawlable subject directories that search engines could discover
- **Dynamic content handling** — solving the challenge of making JavaScript-rendered application content accessible to crawlers
- **Internal linking** — connecting category pages to individual tutor profiles for crawl distribution

## Results

### +600% Application Growth

The web application domain (app.thetutor.link) achieved the standout result — 600% organic traffic growth over three months. This came from:

- Tutor profile pages beginning to rank for long-tail name and subject queries
- Subject category pages gaining visibility for local tutoring searches
- Improved crawl efficiency meaning more pages indexed and ranking

### Steady Marketing Site Growth

The marketing site (thetutor.link) showed consistent growth:

- 47 clicks per quarter from Google organic
- 103 clicks from Bing (2.2x Google performance — notable for an EdTech platform)
- Informational content beginning to rank for tutoring guidance queries

### Cross-Platform Performance

An interesting finding: the two domains performed differently across search engines.

- **Google** favoured the web application (app.thetutor.link) — likely due to richer, more unique content on tutor profile pages
- **Bing** favoured the marketing site (thetutor.link) — suggesting Bing weighted the more structured, traditional website format

This reinforced the importance of the dual-domain strategy — optimising for one platform alone would have missed significant traffic from the other.

## What's Next

The 600% growth spike created momentum that needs capitalising:

1. **Scale tutor profile content** — more detailed, unique profile descriptions that target specific subject and location queries
2. **Build topical authority** — expand the marketing site content to cover tutoring guides, exam preparation, and educational resources
3. **Conversion tracking** — connect organic visibility to actual student-tutor matches to measure SEO ROI
4. **Local SEO** — target location-specific tutoring queries as the platform expands geographically
