problem: >-
  TheTutorLink is an online tutoring marketplace connecting students with
  tutors. The platform had minimal organic visibility — the web application and
  marketing site were generating fewer than 10 clicks per month combined, with
  no structured SEO strategy in place for either domain.
solution: >-
  Implemented a dual-domain SEO strategy — optimising the marketing site
  (thetutor.link) for informational and transactional keywords while improving
  the web application (app.thetutor.link) for tutor profile indexing and subject
  page visibility. Technical SEO foundations were built including structured
  data, sitemap optimisation, and crawl efficiency improvements.
result: >-
  The web application achieved 600 percent organic traffic growth over three
  months, while the marketing site maintained steady growth at 47 clicks per
  quarter. Combined platform visibility reached 89 organic clicks per quarter
  with strong upward momentum, and Bing performance outpaced Google by 2.2x on
  the marketing domain.
