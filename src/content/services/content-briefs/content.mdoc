## What is an SEO Content Brief?

An SEO content brief is a detailed specification document that guides writers to produce semantically optimised content. Content briefs eliminate guesswork by defining heading structure, required entities, internal linking targets, word count, and micro-semantic guidelines. Well-crafted briefs reduce revision cycles by 60% and ensure content aligns with topical authority strategy.

## What Does a Content Brief Include?

Each content brief contains 8 essential components:

**Primary and secondary keywords** with search intent classification identify what users expect when searching these terms, informing tone, depth, and conversion positioning.

**Q-style H2 heading structure** derived from query network analysis ensures the content answers all related questions users ask about the topic.

**Required entities and attributes** to include for semantic completeness specify concepts, definitions, and relationships search engines expect in authoritative content.

**Internal linking targets** with contextual anchor text recommendations distribute ranking signals toward conversion pages whilst providing genuine user value.

**Competitor content analysis** showing gaps and opportunities reveals what competitors cover thoroughly and where your content can differentiate.

**Word count range** based on top-ranking competitor analysis ensures sufficient depth without unnecessary verbosity that dilutes relevance.

**Micro-semantic guidelines** including sentence structure and answer formats specify how to present information for featured snippet eligibility.

**Featured snippet targeting guidance** for eligible queries provides exact answer formats search engines prefer for position zero results.

## How Much Do Content Briefs Cost?

Content brief pricing depends on volume and complexity:

-   Individual briefs: £150 each
-   Package of 10 briefs: £1,200 (£120 each)
-   Package of 25 briefs: £2,500 (£100 each)

Briefs are typically delivered within 2-3 working days per brief. Most businesses commission briefs in batches, allowing writers to work through content systematically rather than addressing topics randomly.

## How Do Content Briefs Fit Into the SEO Process?

Content briefs bridge strategy and implementation. Following [topical map creation](/topical-maps/), each page identified in the map receives a detailed brief. Writers then execute briefs without needing SEO expertise themselves. This division of labour reduces costs whilst maintaining quality.

The brief methodology follows [semantic SEO](/what-is-semantic-seo/) principles, ensuring every page contributes to topical authority rather than existing in isolation. Internal linking recommendations within briefs create the hub-and-spoke architecture that concentrates ranking signals effectively.

## What Makes Your Content Briefs Different?

Many content briefs simply list keywords and word counts. My briefs specify exactly what search engines require for semantic completeness and featured snippet eligibility. Writers receive heading structures, entity requirements, and sentence-level formatting guidance that eliminates revision cycles.

Briefs also include competitor analysis showing what already ranks and why, allowing writers to create genuinely differentiated content rather than replicating existing pages. This approach produces content search engines reward for unique value rather than derivative coverage.

## Do You Provide Writing Services?

I focus on strategy and specifications rather than execution. Most clients have in-house writers or content agencies who execute briefs. This separation allows you to use existing resources whilst ensuring content aligns with semantic SEO methodology.

For businesses without writing resources, I can recommend trusted partners who execute briefs to specification. These partnerships ensure implementation quality whilst allowing me to focus on strategy where my expertise adds most value.
