## What is an SEO Content Brief?

An SEO content brief is a detailed specification document guiding writers to produce semantically optimised content. Briefs eliminate guesswork by defining heading structure, required entities, internal linking targets, word count, and micro-semantic guidelines. Well-crafted briefs reduce revision cycles by 60% and ensure content aligns with topical authority strategy.

## What Does a Content Brief Include?

Each content brief contains 8 essential components:

**Primary and secondary keywords** with search intent classification identify user expectations when searching these terms, informing tone, depth, and conversion positioning.

**Q-style H2 heading structure** derived from query network analysis ensures content answers all related user questions about the topic.

**Required entities and attributes** specify concepts, definitions, and relationships search engines expect in authoritative content.

**Internal linking targets** with contextual anchor text recommendations distribute ranking signals toward conversion pages whilst providing genuine user value.

**Competitor content analysis** reveals what competitors cover thoroughly and where your content can differentiate.

**Word count range** based on top-ranking competitor analysis ensures sufficient depth without unnecessary verbosity.

**Micro-semantic guidelines** including sentence structure and answer formats specify how to present information for featured snippet eligibility.

**Featured snippet targeting guidance** provides exact answer formats search engines prefer for position zero results.

## How Much Do Content Briefs Cost?

Content brief pricing depends on volume and complexity:

- Individual briefs: £150 each
- Package of 10 briefs: £1,200 (£120 each)
- Package of 25 briefs: £2,500 (£100 each)

Briefs are typically delivered within 2-3 working days per brief. Most businesses commission briefs in batches, allowing writers to work through content systematically rather than addressing topics randomly.

## How Do Content Briefs Fit Into the SEO Process?

Content briefs bridge strategy and implementation. Following topical map creation, each identified page receives a detailed brief. Writers then execute briefs without needing SEO expertise. This division of labour reduces costs whilst maintaining quality.

The brief methodology follows semantic SEO principles, ensuring every page contributes to topical authority. Internal linking recommendations within briefs create hub-and-spoke architecture that concentrates ranking signals effectively.

## What Makes Your Content Briefs Different?

Many content briefs simply list keywords and word counts. These briefs specify exactly what search engines require for semantic completeness and featured snippet eligibility. Writers receive heading structures, entity requirements, and sentence-level formatting guidance eliminating revision cycles.

Briefs include competitor analysis showing what already ranks and why, allowing writers to create genuinely differentiated content rather than replicating existing pages. This approach produces content search engines reward for unique value.

## Do You Provide Writing Services?

The focus is on strategy and specifications rather than execution. Most clients have in-house writers or content agencies who execute briefs. This separation allows existing resources usage whilst ensuring content aligns with semantic SEO methodology.

For businesses without writing resources, trusted partners can be recommended for brief execution. These partnerships ensure implementation quality whilst allowing focus on strategy where expertise adds most value.
