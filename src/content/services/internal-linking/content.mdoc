## What is Internal Linking Strategy?

Internal linking strategy creates hub-and-spoke architectures that distribute ranking signals effectively. The service maps page relationships, defines anchor text patterns, and implements linking hierarchies that guide both users and search engines through your content logically. Strategic internal links concentrate PageRank toward conversion pages whilst maintaining natural browsing experiences.

## How Does Internal Linking Support SEO?

Internal linking influences rankings through 3 core mechanisms:

**PageRank distribution** channels authority accumulated from external backlinks toward high-priority conversion pages rather than diluting it equally across all content.

**Topical relevance signaling** uses anchor text and link context to communicate page relationships, helping search engines understand content hierarchies and authority signals.

**Crawl efficiency** ensures search engines discover all important pages efficiently through logical navigation paths, preventing valuable content from remaining hidden due to structural isolation.

## What Does Internal Linking Strategy Include?

Comprehensive internal linking strategy delivers 5 core outputs:

**Page relationship mapping** categorises pages into hubs (authority centres) and spokes (supporting content), defining which pages should receive concentrated linking attention.

**Linking hierarchy design** creates tiered structures where outer content links to mid-tier pages, which aggregate signals and link to primary conversion pages.

**Anchor text guidelines** specify natural, contextual anchor text patterns that communicate relevance without over-optimisation that triggers manipulation detection.

**Implementation roadmap** prioritises linking additions based on maximum impact, showing which links to add first for immediate ranking improvements.

**Ongoing linking principles** establish rules for future content creation, ensuring new pages integrate into existing architecture rather than creating orphans.

## How Much Does Internal Linking Strategy Cost?

Internal linking strategy pricing depends on site size and complexity:

-   Small sites (under 50 pages): £500
-   Medium sites (50-200 pages): £800
-   Large sites (200+ pages): £1,200+

Strategy is typically delivered within 3-5 working days. The deliverable includes spreadsheets mapping current links, recommended additions, and priority scoring that guides implementation systematically.

## What Makes Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Effective?

Hub-and-spoke architecture mimics how authority websites naturally organise content. Comprehensive hub pages covering broad topics link to detailed spoke pages addressing specific subtopics. This structure allows:

**Concentrated signals** flow toward hubs receiving links from multiple spokes, building authority pages that rank competitively for valuable head terms.

**Logical user journeys** guide visitors from broad introductory content toward specific information they need, improving engagement metrics that feed rankings.

**Scalable expansion** accommodates new content by adding spokes to existing hubs rather than creating disconnected pages that dilute overall authority.

This architecture follows [semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) principles, organising content by topic relationships rather than arbitrary navigation decisions. Combined with [topical maps](/services/topical-maps/), hub-and-spoke structures build comprehensive topical authority efficiently.

## Where Should Internal Links Point?

Link targets follow clear prioritisation:

**Core conversion pages** receive links from all relevant outer content, concentrating signals toward pages generating revenue rather than purely informational content.

**Authority hubs** aggregate links from related spoke pages, building comprehensive resources that rank for valuable mid-tail queries.

**Related content** connects horizontally between peer pages covering adjacent subtopics, keeping users engaged whilst distributing signals laterally.

**Orphan pages** with valuable content but poor linking integration receive strategic connections that unlock their ranking potential through improved crawl accessibility.

The strategy defined in [topical maps](/services/topical-maps/) specifies these relationships explicitly. Internal linking implementation then executes the planned architecture systematically.

## How Does Internal Linking Work With Other Services?

Internal linking strategy combines with [on-page SEO](/services/on-page-seo/) to optimise individual pages whilst connecting them effectively. [Content briefs](/services/content-briefs/) include internal linking specifications, ensuring new content integrates into existing architecture from publication.

Many businesses commission internal linking strategy following a [technical SEO audit](/services/technical-seo-audit/) that identifies orphan pages and structural issues preventing effective linking. Technical foundations support strategic linking rather than undermining it through architectural limitations.

## What Results Can I Expect from Internal Linking?

Internal linking improvements typically show ranking impacts within 4-12 weeks as search engines recrawl and re-evaluate page authority. Pages receiving concentrated linking attention often gain 3-10 position improvements for target queries.

The most significant improvements occur on pages with quality content but poor linking integration. Adding strategic internal links unlocks ranking potential that existing content quality warrants but structural isolation previously prevented.
