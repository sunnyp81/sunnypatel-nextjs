## What is Internal Linking Strategy?

Internal linking strategy creates hub-and-spoke architectures that distribute ranking signals effectively. The service maps page relationships, defines anchor text patterns, and implements linking hierarchies that guide both users and search engines through your content logically.

## How Does Internal Linking Support SEO?

Internal linking influences rankings through 3 core mechanisms:

**PageRank distribution** channels authority toward high-priority conversion pages.

**Topical relevance signaling** uses anchor text and link context to communicate page relationships.

**Crawl efficiency** ensures search engines discover all important pages efficiently through logical navigation paths.

## What Does Internal Linking Strategy Include?

5 core outputs:

**Page relationship mapping** categorises pages into hubs and spokes.

**Linking hierarchy design** creates tiered structures where outer content links to mid-tier pages, which aggregate signals and link to primary conversion pages.

**Anchor text guidelines** specify natural, contextual anchor text patterns.

**Implementation roadmap** prioritises linking additions based on maximum impact.

**Ongoing linking principles** establish rules for future content creation.

## How Much Does Internal Linking Strategy Cost?

- Small sites (under 50 pages): £500
- Medium sites (50-200 pages): £800
- Large sites (200+ pages): £1,200+

## What Makes Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Effective?

Comprehensive hub pages covering broad topics link to detailed spoke pages addressing specific subtopics. This allows concentrated signals, logical user journeys, and scalable expansion.

## Where Should Internal Links Point?

**Core conversion pages** receive links from all relevant outer content.

**Authority hubs** aggregate links from related spoke pages.

**Related content** connects horizontally between peer pages.

**Orphan pages** with valuable content receive strategic connections.

## What Results Can I Expect from Internal Linking?

Internal linking improvements typically show ranking impacts within 4-12 weeks. Pages receiving concentrated linking attention often gain 3-10 position improvements for target queries.
