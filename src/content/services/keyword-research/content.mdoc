## What is Keyword Research?

Keyword research identifies search demand, clusters queries by intent, and prioritises opportunities based on competition and business value. The research informs content priorities, URL structures, and internal linking architecture. Comprehensive keyword research reveals not just what people search, but why they search and what they expect to find.

## How Does Keyword Research Support Topical Authority?

Keyword research feeds directly into [topical map creation](/services/topical-maps/) by identifying all queries within your subject area. Rather than targeting high-volume keywords in isolation, research reveals query networks showing how users explore topics. These networks inform content architecture that addresses user needs comprehensively.

The research identifies 4 query intent types:

**Informational queries** answer questions and provide knowledge, building topical authority through comprehensive coverage without direct conversion pressure.

**Commercial queries** compare options and evaluate solutions, sitting mid-funnel where users research before purchasing but haven't committed to specific providers.

**Transactional queries** indicate purchase intent, targeting these terms on service pages maximises conversion potential from organic traffic.

**Navigational queries** seek specific brands or websites, these typically benefit from existing brand authority rather than content optimisation alone.

## What Does Keyword Research Include?

Comprehensive keyword research delivers 6 core outputs:

**Search volume data** shows monthly search estimates for each query, allowing prioritisation based on potential traffic value rather than assumptions.

**Competition analysis** evaluates which queries face saturated SERPs versus underserved opportunities where quality content gains traction quickly.

**Intent classification** categorises queries by user expectations, ensuring content format matches what users want rather than forcing fit.

**Query clustering** groups related searches into topics, revealing comprehensive coverage opportunities that [semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) methodology requires.

**Competitor keyword gaps** identifies queries competitors rank for that you should address, alongside opportunities competitors overlook completely.

**Priority scoring** ranks opportunities by effort-versus-impact, showing which topics to tackle first for maximum early ranking improvements.

## How Much Does Keyword Research Cost?

Keyword research pricing depends on industry complexity and competitive analysis depth:

-   Focused research (single topic): £400
-   Comprehensive research (full site): £800
-   Enterprise research (multiple sites/regions): £1,500+

Research is typically delivered within 3-5 working days. The deliverable includes spreadsheets with search volumes, competition scores, and priority rankings that inform content planning immediately.

## How Does Keyword Research Differ from Topic Planning?

Traditional keyword research produces lists of search terms without strategic context. My research maps query relationships, identifies content gaps, and prioritises topics based on business value. This strategic approach feeds [content briefs](/services/content-briefs/) that writers execute without requiring SEO expertise themselves.

Research also informs URL structure and [internal linking strategy](/services/internal-linking/), ensuring technical implementation supports topical authority development. Keywords aren't just targets; they're architectural components that shape site structure.

## What Tools Do You Use for Keyword Research?

Research combines data from multiple sources for comprehensive coverage:

-   Google Search Console for existing ranking performance
-   Keyword research platforms for search volumes and competition
-   Competitor analysis tools for gap identification
-   Google autocomplete and related searches for query networks
-   Search intent classification through manual SERP analysis

This multi-source approach reveals opportunities single-tool research misses. Understanding what already ranks shows why it ranks, informing content strategies that compete effectively.

## How Often Should Keyword Research Be Updated?

Initial research establishes topic priorities and content architecture. Most businesses revisit research every 12-18 months to identify new opportunities as their authority grows. High-volume publishing strategies benefit from quarterly research updates ensuring content priorities align with search demand evolution.

[Technical SEO audits](/services/technical-seo-audit/) often include keyword research focused on existing pages, identifying optimisation opportunities before commissioning new content. This combination maximises value from current assets whilst planning expansion strategically.
