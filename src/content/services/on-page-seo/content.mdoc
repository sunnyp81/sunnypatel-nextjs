## What is On-Page SEO?

On-page SEO refines existing content for improved relevance and featured snippet eligibility. The service optimises title tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, and content structure. Each page receives entity analysis, semantic completeness scoring, and update recommendations that improve rankings without requiring complete content rewrites.

## What Does On-Page SEO Include?

On-page SEO optimisation addresses 7 core elements:

**Title tag optimisation** ensures each page has a unique, keyword-rich title under 60 characters that accurately describes content whilst incorporating primary search terms search engines match to queries.

**Meta description refinement** crafts compelling 140-160 character descriptions that improve click-through rates from search results, influencing traffic volume even when rankings remain constant.

**Heading hierarchy restructuring** converts loose content into Q-style H2 headings that answer specific user queries, improving featured snippet eligibility and on-page user experience.

**Entity density analysis** identifies required entities missing from content, adding semantic completeness that search engines require for comprehensive topical coverage.

**Internal linking insertion** adds contextual links to related pages following [internal linking strategy](/internal-linking/) principles, distributing ranking signals effectively throughout your site.

**Featured snippet formatting** restructures answers into formats search engines prefer for position zero results, capturing valuable visibility above traditional organic listings.

**Image optimisation** adds descriptive alt text, compresses file sizes, and implements lazy loading where appropriate, improving page speed whilst ensuring image search visibility.

## How Much Does On-Page SEO Cost?

On-page SEO pricing depends on content complexity and optimisation depth:

-   Standard page optimisation: £100 per page
-   Complex page (technical/long-form): £150 per page
-   Package of 10 pages: £800 (£80 per page)
-   Full site audit with recommendations: £500+ (depends on site size)

Optimisation typically completes within 1-2 working days per page. Most businesses start with high-priority pages showing impression growth in Search Console but lacking sufficient click-through rates.

## How Does On-Page SEO Differ from Content Briefs?

[Content briefs](/content-briefs/) guide creation of new content following [semantic SEO](/what-is-semantic-seo/) methodology. On-page SEO optimises existing content that lacks strategic structure or semantic completeness.

Many businesses have substantial content archives requiring optimisation before commissioning new pages. On-page SEO extracts maximum value from existing assets whilst new content development follows more comprehensive topical mapping.

## Which Pages Benefit Most from On-Page Optimisation?

Prioritise on-page SEO for pages showing specific performance patterns in Google Search Console:

**High impressions, low clicks** indicate visibility without compelling result presentation, suggesting title tag and meta description improvements would increase traffic immediately.

**Position 4-10 rankings** sit below the fold where small relevance improvements push pages into top 3 positions, delivering disproportionate traffic gains for minimal effort.

**Pages targeting featured snippets** ranking in positions 1-5 for queries showing snippet results benefit from answer formatting that captures position zero placement.

**Conversion pages with traffic** already receiving visitors but failing to convert benefit from structural improvements that guide users toward desired actions more effectively.

## How Does On-Page SEO Support Topical Authority?

On-page optimisation ensures each page contributes effectively to overall topical authority. Pages lacking semantic completeness or proper entity coverage dilute site-wide authority signals rather than reinforcing expertise.

Systematic on-page optimisation transforms disconnected content into cohesive networks search engines recognise as authoritative. Combined with [topical maps](/topical-maps/) for new content planning, on-page SEO creates comprehensive topical coverage efficiently.

## What Happens After On-Page Optimisation?

Most pages show ranking improvements within 2-8 weeks following optimisation as search engines re-evaluate relevance. Traffic increases follow ranking improvements, with exact timing depending on competition and seasonal search patterns.

Optimised pages require periodic review every 6-9 months as search intent evolves and competitor content improves. Ongoing optimisation maintains competitive positions rather than assuming initial optimisation remains effective indefinitely.

Many businesses commission a [technical SEO audit](/technical-seo-audit/) before on-page optimisation, ensuring technical issues don't undermine content improvements. Technical foundations support on-page work rather than competing with it.
