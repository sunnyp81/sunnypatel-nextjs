## What is On-Page SEO?

On-page SEO refines existing content for improved relevance and featured snippet eligibility. The service optimises title tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, and content structure. Each page receives entity analysis, semantic completeness scoring, and update recommendations that improve rankings without requiring complete content rewrites.

## What Does On-Page SEO Include?

On-page SEO optimisation addresses 7 core elements:

**Title tag optimisation** ensures each page has a unique, keyword-rich title under 60 characters that accurately describes content whilst incorporating primary search terms.

**Meta description refinement** crafts compelling 140-160 character descriptions that improve click-through rates from search results.

**Heading hierarchy restructuring** converts loose content into Q-style H2 headings that answer specific user queries, improving featured snippet eligibility.

**Entity density analysis** identifies required entities missing from content, adding semantic completeness that search engines require for comprehensive topical coverage.

**Internal linking insertion** adds contextual links to related pages following internal linking strategy principles, distributing ranking signals effectively throughout your site.

**Featured snippet formatting** restructures answers into formats search engines prefer for position zero results.

**Image optimisation** adds descriptive alt text, compresses file sizes, and implements lazy loading where appropriate.

## How Much Does On-Page SEO Cost?

- Standard page optimisation: £100 per page
- Complex page (technical/long-form): £150 per page
- Package of 10 pages: £800 (£80 per page)
- Full site audit with recommendations: £500+ (depends on site size)

## How Does On-Page SEO Differ from Content Briefs?

Content briefs guide creation of new content following semantic SEO methodology. On-page SEO optimises existing content that lacks strategic structure or semantic completeness.

## Which Pages Benefit Most from On-Page Optimisation?

**High impressions, low clicks** indicate visibility without compelling result presentation.

**Position 4-10 rankings** sit below the fold where small relevance improvements push pages into top 3 positions.

**Pages targeting featured snippets** ranking in positions 1-5 benefit from answer formatting that captures position zero placement.

**Conversion pages with traffic** already receiving visitors but failing to convert benefit from structural improvements.

## How Does On-Page SEO Support Topical Authority?

On-page optimisation ensures each page contributes effectively to overall topical authority. Pages lacking semantic completeness or proper entity coverage dilute site-wide authority signals. Systematic on-page optimisation transforms disconnected content into cohesive networks search engines recognise as authoritative.

## What Happens After On-Page Optimisation?

Most pages show ranking improvements within 2-8 weeks following optimisation. Optimised pages require periodic review every 6-9 months as search intent evolves and competitor content improves.
