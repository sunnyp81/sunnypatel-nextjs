## What is SEO Strategy Consulting?

SEO strategy consulting delivers expert guidance for organizations seeking direction without comprehensive implementation. Sessions analyze current state, identify opportunities, provide prioritized recommendations, and outline actionable next steps. This option suits in-house teams needing specialist input or businesses evaluating comprehensive SEO investment.

## What Do Consulting Sessions Include?

Each consulting session delivers four core components:

### Current State Analysis
Evaluation includes organic traffic trends, keyword rankings, technical health, and content quality. Google Search Console data review identifies what's performing and what restricts growth.

### Opportunity Identification
Analysis covers competitor strategies, search demand, and approach gaps. Opportunities span quick-win optimizations, topical map development for authority building, or technical fixes blocking rankings.

### Prioritised Recommendations
Actionable recommendations ranked by effort and impact. Each includes implementation guidance, expected outcomes, and resource requirements. Clear priorities focus teams on highest-return changes.

### Strategic Roadmap
Twelve-month SEO roadmap showing initiative sequencing, connections, and success definitions. Roadmaps address technical SEO improvements, content development phases, and ongoing optimization cycles.

## Who Benefits from SEO Consulting?

### In-House Marketing Teams
Teams managing SEO internally need specialist expertise for strategy validation, technical problem-solving, or algorithm update awareness. Consulting provides expert input without replacing your team.

### Businesses Between Agencies
Organizations transitioning between agencies or evaluating in-house SEO need objective assessment and clear direction.

### Startups and Growing Businesses
Early-stage companies establish strong SEO foundations before scaling content production. Strategic consulting prevents costly mistakes and ensures high-impact resource allocation.

### Businesses Evaluating SEO Investment
Organizations uncertain about SEO suitability receive honest ROI assessment and realistic result timelines.

## How Much Does SEO Consulting Cost?

SEO consulting begins at £200 per session. Options include:

- **Single 90-minute session:** £200
- **Monthly retainer (4 hours):** £600
- **Quarterly strategy review:** £500

Most clients start with a single session to establish relationships and assess value before committing to ongoing consulting.

## What Happens During a Consulting Session?

### Pre-Session Preparation
Clients provide Google Search Console access, Google Analytics access (if available), and specific questions. Pre-session review maximizes productive discussion time.

### Session Delivery
Sixty to ninety-minute video calls cover analysis findings, opportunity discussion, and recommendation development. Sessions remain interactive, allowing questions and deeper topic exploration.

### Post-Session Documentation
Within 48 hours, clients receive written recommendations, implementation guidance, and strategic roadmap documentation.

## How is Consulting Different from Full-Service SEO?

Consulting provides strategic direction while your team handles implementation. This approach suits businesses with internal resources seeking expert guidance. For comprehensive implementation including content brief development, technical execution, and ongoing optimization, full-service retainers starting at £1,500 monthly offer better value.

## What Topics Do Consulting Sessions Cover?

Sessions address whatever challenges your business faces:

- **Technical SEO strategy:** Crawlability, indexation, site speed, mobile optimisation
- **Content strategy:** Semantic SEO methodology, topical authority building, publication planning
- **Local SEO:** Google Business Profile optimisation, local citation strategy, location page development
- **Keyword research:** Search demand analysis, query network mapping, prioritisation frameworks
- **Internal linking:** Hub-and-spoke architecture, anchor text strategy, link distribution
- **Performance analysis:** Traffic pattern interpretation, ranking volatility diagnosis, algorithm update assessment

## How Often Should You Schedule Consulting Sessions?

Frequency depends on team experience and project pace:

- **Monthly sessions:** Ongoing strategic guidance for active SEO programmes
- **Quarterly sessions:** Periodic direction for established programmes with experienced teams
- **Ad-hoc sessions:** Problem-solving for specific challenges or major strategic decisions

Most businesses benefit from monthly sessions during initial strategy development, transitioning to quarterly sessions once foundations are established.

## Can Consulting Lead to Full-Service Engagement?

Yes, many clients begin with consulting to establish relationships and assess value before comprehensive implementation engagement. This approach reduces risk while ensuring strategic alignment before larger investments. Others maintain consulting relationships long-term, preferring strategic guidance while handling execution internally.
