## What is SEO Strategy Consulting?

SEO strategy consulting provides expert guidance for businesses wanting direction without full-service implementation. Sessions cover current state analysis, opportunity identification, prioritised recommendations, and actionable next steps. Ideal for in-house teams needing specialist input to refine their approach or businesses evaluating whether to invest in comprehensive [SEO services](/services/).

## What Do Consulting Sessions Include?

Each consulting session delivers 4 core components:

### Current State Analysis

Evaluation of your existing SEO performance including organic traffic trends, keyword rankings, technical health, and content quality. I review Google Search Console data to identify what's working and what's holding back growth.

### Opportunity Identification

Analysis of competitor strategies, search demand in your industry, and gaps in your current approach. Opportunities might include quick-win optimisations, [topical map development](/topical-maps/) for authority building, or technical fixes blocking rankings.

### Prioritised Recommendations

Actionable recommendations ranked by effort and impact. Each recommendation includes implementation guidance, expected outcomes, and resource requirements. Clear priorities help teams focus on changes delivering the greatest return.

### Strategic Roadmap

12-month SEO roadmap showing which initiatives to tackle first, how they connect, and what success looks like. Roadmaps might include [technical SEO improvements](/technical-seo-audit/), content development phases, and ongoing optimisation cycles.

## Who Benefits from SEO Consulting?

SEO consulting suits several business situations:

### In-House Marketing Teams

Teams handling SEO internally but needing specialist expertise for strategy validation, technical problem-solving, or staying current with algorithm changes. Consulting provides expert input without replacing your team.

### Businesses Between Agencies

Companies transitioning between SEO agencies or evaluating whether to bring SEO in-house. Consulting provides objective assessment of current state and clear direction for next steps.

### Startups and Growing Businesses

Early-stage companies wanting to establish strong SEO foundations before scaling content production. Strategic consulting prevents costly mistakes and ensures resources focus on high-impact activities.

### Businesses Evaluating SEO Investment

Organisations uncertain whether SEO suits their business model or growth goals. Consulting provides honest assessment of potential ROI and realistic timelines for results.

## How Much Does SEO Consulting Cost?

SEO consulting costs from £200 per session. Session formats include:

-   **Single 90-minute session:** £200
-   **Monthly retainer (4 hours):** £600
-   **Quarterly strategy review:** £500

Most clients start with a single session to establish the relationship and assess value before committing to ongoing consulting.

## What Happens During a Consulting Session?

Consulting sessions follow a structured approach:

### Pre-Session Preparation

You provide Google Search Console access, Google Analytics access (if available), and specific questions or challenges you want addressed. I review your data before the session to maximise productive discussion time.

### Session Delivery

60-90 minute video call covering analysis findings, opportunity discussion, and recommendation development. Sessions are interactive, allowing questions and deeper exploration of relevant topics.

### Post-Session Documentation

Within 48 hours, you receive written documentation of recommendations, implementation guidance, and strategic roadmap. Documentation ensures your team can execute recommendations without ongoing support.

## How is Consulting Different from Full-Service SEO?

Consulting provides strategic direction while your team handles implementation. This approach suits businesses with internal resources wanting expert guidance to inform their work. For businesses wanting comprehensive implementation support including [content brief development](/content-briefs/), technical execution, and ongoing optimisation, full-service retainers starting at £1,500 monthly provide better value.

## What Topics Do Consulting Sessions Cover?

Consulting sessions address whatever challenges your business faces:

-   **Technical SEO strategy:** Crawlability, indexation, site speed, mobile optimisation
-   **Content strategy:** [Semantic SEO methodology](/what-is-semantic-seo/), topical authority building, publication planning
-   **Local SEO:** Google Business Profile optimisation, local citation strategy, location page development
-   **Keyword research:** Search demand analysis, query network mapping, prioritisation frameworks
-   **Internal linking:** Hub-and-spoke architecture, anchor text strategy, link distribution
-   **Performance analysis:** Traffic pattern interpretation, ranking volatility diagnosis, algorithm update assessment

## How Often Should You Schedule Consulting Sessions?

Frequency depends on your team's experience and project pace:

-   **Monthly sessions:** Ongoing strategic guidance for active SEO programmes
-   **Quarterly sessions:** Periodic direction for established programmes with experienced teams
-   **Ad-hoc sessions:** Problem-solving for specific challenges or major strategic decisions

Most businesses benefit from monthly sessions during initial strategy development, transitioning to quarterly sessions once foundations are established.

## Can Consulting Lead to Full-Service Engagement?

Yes, many clients begin with consulting to establish the relationship and assess value before engaging for comprehensive implementation. This approach reduces risk while ensuring strategic alignment before committing to larger investments. Others maintain consulting relationships long-term, preferring strategic guidance while handling execution internally.
