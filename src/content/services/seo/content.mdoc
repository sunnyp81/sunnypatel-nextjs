## What is SEO?

SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is the practice of optimising websites to rank higher in search engine results pages for relevant queries. SEO increases organic visibility, drives qualified traffic, and generates leads without ongoing advertising costs. Effective SEO combines technical optimisation, content strategy, and authority building.

## How Does SEO Work?

SEO works by aligning your website with search engine ranking algorithms. Search engines like Google use 200+ ranking factors to determine which pages best answer user queries. SEO optimises these factors across 3 core areas:

**Technical SEO** addresses site speed, mobile usability, crawlability, and indexation issues that prevent search engines from accessing or understanding your content effectively.

**On-page SEO** improves content quality, keyword targeting, heading structure, and internal links that communicate relevance for specific queries to search engines.

**Off-page SEO** builds backlinks, brand mentions, and social signals that establish external authority, signaling to search engines that others recognise your expertise.

These three areas work together systematically. Technical foundations support content optimisation, whilst external authority validates the quality signals your optimised content communicates. My [SEO services](/services/) address all three areas comprehensively.

## Why is SEO Important for Businesses?

SEO delivers 5 key benefits for businesses:

**Cost-effective traffic** generates organic visitors that cost 61% less than paid advertising over time, improving marketing efficiency as rankings compound.

**Qualified leads** reach users actively searching for your products or services, delivering higher conversion rates than interruption-based advertising.

**Brand credibility** benefits from high rankings that signal trust and authority to users, influencing purchasing decisions even when users don't immediately convert.

**Competitive advantage** captures market share by outranking competitors for valuable queries, redirecting their potential customers to your content instead.

**Long-term results** compound over time unlike paid advertising that stops delivering immediately when spending stops, creating sustainable growth advantages.

## What Are the Main Types of SEO?

SEO divides into 4 main types:

**Technical SEO** focuses on website infrastructure and performance, addressing crawlability, indexation, site speed, and Core Web Vitals that enable or prevent effective ranking.

**On-page SEO** optimises individual page content and structure, refining titles, headings, entity coverage, and [internal linking](/services/internal-linking/) that communicates relevance.

**Off-page SEO** builds external authority through links and mentions, establishing expertise signals that search engines validate through third-party references.

**Local SEO** targets geographic-specific searches and Google Maps visibility, essential for businesses serving specific geographic areas like my [local SEO Reading](/services/seo-consultant-reading/) services.

## How Does SEO Differ from Paid Advertising?

SEO generates organic visibility through content quality and technical optimisation, whilst paid advertising purchases immediate placement through financial bidding. SEO requires upfront investment but delivers compounding returns as authority builds. Paid advertising provides instant visibility but stops immediately when spending stops.

Most businesses benefit from combined approaches: paid advertising generates immediate leads whilst SEO builds sustainable visibility. My [semantic SEO methodology](/services/semantic-seo/) focuses specifically on organic visibility that compounds over time.

## How Long Does SEO Take?

SEO results typically appear within 3-6 months for competitive terms, though some improvements show within 4-8 weeks. Initial gains come from [technical fixes](/services/technical-seo-audit/) and quick-win optimisations. Sustained ranking improvements require consistent content publication and topical authority building over 6-12 months.

Results vary based on competition, website age, existing authority, and content quality. New websites face longer timelines than established sites adding SEO optimisation. Highly competitive industries require more comprehensive strategies than niche markets with limited competition.

## What Makes Semantic SEO Different?

Traditional SEO targets individual keywords in isolation. [Semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) builds topical authority through comprehensive coverage of entire subject areas. This methodology creates sustainable rankings because search engines recognise genuine expertise rather than superficial keyword optimisation.

My approach centres on semantic methodology, building [topical authority](/services/topical-authority/) through strategic content architecture rather than outdated keyword stuffing. This creates lasting competitive advantages that compound over time.
