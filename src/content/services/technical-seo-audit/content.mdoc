## What is a Technical SEO Audit?

A technical SEO audit is a comprehensive analysis of your website's infrastructure, identifying issues that prevent search engines from effectively crawling, indexing, and ranking your pages. Technical audits examine 50+ ranking factors across site architecture, server configuration, mobile usability, page speed, and structured data implementation.

## What Does the Audit Include?

The technical SEO audit covers 7 core analysis areas:

**Crawlability analysis:** robots.txt configuration, XML sitemaps accuracy, crawl budget optimisation, and URL parameter handling ensure search engines access all important pages efficiently.

**Indexation review:** index coverage issues, duplicate content detection, canonical implementation, and meta robots directives prevent wasted crawl budget on low-value pages.

**Core Web Vitals:** LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), INP (Interaction to Next Paint), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) performance across device types identifies user experience bottlenecks.

**Mobile usability:** responsive design implementation, touch target sizing, viewport configuration, and mobile-specific rendering issues ensure accessibility across devices.

**Site architecture:** URL structure consistency, internal linking efficiency, navigation depth, and orphan page detection optimise how PageRank flows through your site.

**Schema markup:** structured data implementation, validation against Schema.org standards, and rich result eligibility enhance search result appearances.

**Security and accessibility:** HTTPS implementation, accessibility compliance against WCAG standards, and security header configuration protect users whilst improving rankings.

## What Are the Deliverables?

The audit delivers 4 core outputs:

**Executive summary** with critical findings and business impact quantifies how technical issues affect organic performance and revenue.

**Prioritised recommendations spreadsheet** with effort/impact scoring helps your team tackle high-value fixes first rather than addressing issues randomly.

**Competitor technical benchmarking** comparing your site to 3 competitors shows where you're ahead or behind in technical implementation.

**Implementation guidance document** with developer-ready specifications removes ambiguity about what needs changing and how to change it.

## How Much Does a Technical SEO Audit Cost?

Technical SEO audit pricing depends on website size and complexity:

-   Small sites (under 100 pages): £500
-   Medium sites (100-500 pages): £800
-   Large sites (500+ pages): £1,200+

All audits include a 60-minute consultation call to review findings and discuss implementation priorities. The audit feeds directly into [topical map creation](/topical-maps/) by identifying technical constraints that influence content architecture.

## What Happens After the Audit?

Most businesses implement audit recommendations in-house using their existing development team. I provide clear specifications and remain available for questions during implementation. Alternatively, I can manage implementation through trusted development partners.

Following technical fixes, many clients commission [content briefs](/content-briefs/) to build topical authority on their now-solid technical foundation. Learn more about [what is SEO](/what-is-seo/) and how technical optimisation fits into broader organic growth strategies.
