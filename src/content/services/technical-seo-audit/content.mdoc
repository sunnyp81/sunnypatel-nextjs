## What is a Technical SEO Audit?

A comprehensive analysis of your website's infrastructure, identifying issues that prevent search engines from effectively crawling, indexing, and ranking your pages. Technical audits examine 50+ ranking factors across site architecture, server configuration, mobile usability, page speed, and structured data implementation.

## What Does the Audit Include?

The technical SEO audit covers 7 core analysis areas:

**Crawlability analysis:** robots.txt configuration, XML sitemaps accuracy, crawl budget optimisation, and URL parameter handling ensure search engines access all important pages efficiently.

**Indexation review:** index coverage issues, duplicate content detection, canonical implementation, and meta robots directives prevent wasted crawl budget on low-value pages.

**Core Web Vitals:** LCP, INP, and CLS performance across device types identifies user experience bottlenecks.

**Mobile usability:** responsive design implementation, touch target sizing, viewport configuration, and mobile-specific rendering issues ensure accessibility across devices.

**Site architecture:** URL structure consistency, internal linking efficiency, navigation depth, and orphan page detection optimise how PageRank flows through your site.

**Schema markup:** structured data implementation, validation against Schema.org standards, and rich result eligibility enhance search result appearances.

**Security and accessibility:** HTTPS implementation, accessibility compliance against WCAG standards, and security header configuration protect users whilst improving rankings.

## What Are the Deliverables?

The audit delivers 4 core outputs:

**Executive summary** with critical findings and business impact quantifies how technical issues affect organic performance and revenue.

**Prioritised recommendations spreadsheet** with effort/impact scoring helps your team tackle high-value fixes first rather than addressing issues randomly.

**Competitor technical benchmarking** comparing your site to 3 competitors shows where you're ahead or behind in technical implementation.

**Implementation guidance document** with developer-ready specifications removes ambiguity about what needs changing and how to change it.

## How Much Does a Technical SEO Audit Cost?

Technical SEO audit pricing depends on website size and complexity:

- Small sites (under 100 pages): £500
- Medium sites (100-500 pages): £800
- Large sites (500+ pages): £1,200+

All audits include a 60-minute consultation call to review findings and discuss implementation priorities.

## What Happens After the Audit?

Most businesses implement audit recommendations in-house using their existing development team. Clear specifications are provided with ongoing support for questions during implementation. Alternatively, implementation can be managed through trusted development partners.

Following technical fixes, many clients commission content briefs to build topical authority on their now-solid technical foundation.
