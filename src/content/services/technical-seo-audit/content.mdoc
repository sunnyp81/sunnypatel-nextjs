## What is a Technical SEO Audit?

A technical SEO audit is a comprehensive analysis of your website's infrastructure, identifying issues that prevent search engines from effectively crawling, indexing, and ranking your pages. Technical audits examine 50+ ranking factors across site architecture, server configuration, mobile usability, page speed, and structured data implementation.

## What Does the Audit Include?

The technical SEO audit covers 7 core analysis areas:

**Crawlability analysis:** robots.txt configuration, XML sitemaps accuracy, crawl budget optimisation, and URL parameter handling ensure search engines access all important pages efficiently.

**Indexation review:** index coverage issues, duplicate content detection, canonical implementation, and meta robots directives prevent wasted crawl budget on low-value pages.

**Core Web Vitals:** LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), INP (Interaction to Next Paint), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) performance across device types identifies user experience bottlenecks.

**Mobile usability:** responsive design implementation, touch target sizing, viewport configuration, and mobile-specific rendering issues ensure accessibility across devices.

**Site architecture:** URL structure consistency, internal linking efficiency, navigation depth, and orphan page detection optimise how PageRank flows through your site.

**Schema markup:** structured data implementation, validation against Schema.org standards, and rich result eligibility enhance search result appearances.

**Security and accessibility:** HTTPS implementation, accessibility compliance against WCAG standards, and security header configuration protect users whilst improving rankings.

## What Are the Deliverables?

The audit delivers 4 core outputs:

**Executive summary** with critical findings and business impact quantifies how technical issues affect organic performance and revenue.

**Prioritised recommendations spreadsheet** with effort/impact scoring helps your team tackle high-value fixes first rather than addressing issues randomly.

**Competitor technical benchmarking** comparing your site to 3 competitors shows where you're ahead or behind in technical implementation.

**Implementation guidance document** with developer-ready specifications removes ambiguity about what needs changing and how to change it.

## How Much Does a Technical SEO Audit Cost?

Technical SEO audit pricing depends on website size and complexity:

-   Small sites (under 100 pages): £500
-   Medium sites (100-500 pages): £800
-   Large sites (500+ pages): £1,200+

All audits include a 60-minute consultation call to review findings and discuss implementation priorities. The audit feeds directly into [topical map creation](/services/topical-maps/) by identifying technical constraints that influence content architecture.

## What Happens After the Audit?

Most businesses implement audit recommendations in-house using their existing development team. I provide clear specifications and remain available for questions during implementation. Alternatively, I can manage implementation through trusted development partners.

Following technical fixes, many clients commission [content briefs](/services/content-briefs/) to build topical authority on their now-solid technical foundation. Learn more about [what is SEO](/services/seo/) and how technical optimisation fits into broader organic growth strategies.

## What Are SEO Audit Services?

SEO audit services encompass a range of professional analyses designed to identify why a website underperforms in search results and what to do about it. Whilst "technical SEO audit" focuses specifically on infrastructure and crawlability, the broader category of SEO audit services covers four distinct audit types — each addressing a different layer of organic performance.

**Technical audits** examine the foundation: crawlability, indexation, Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, structured data, and server configuration. These are the issues covered in detail above. Without a solid technical base, no amount of content or link building produces sustainable rankings.

**Content audits** evaluate the quality, relevance, and topical coverage of your existing pages. This includes identifying thin content, cannibalisation issues (multiple pages competing for the same query), outdated information, and gaps where competitors rank but you have no coverage. Content audits feed directly into [topical authority strategies](/services/topical-authority/) and [semantic SEO](/services/semantic-seo/) improvements.

**Backlink audits** analyse your site's link profile for toxic links, unnatural anchor text patterns, and link velocity anomalies that could trigger algorithmic penalties. They also benchmark your backlink profile against competitors to identify link gap opportunities.

**Competitive audits** compare your site's technical health, content depth, and authority signals against 3-5 direct competitors. Understanding where competitors outperform you — whether in page speed, topical coverage, or [internal linking](/services/internal-linking/) structure — provides a prioritised roadmap for closing the gap.

Professional SEO audit services combine multiple audit types into a single engagement. My technical SEO audit includes elements of all four, ensuring you receive a complete picture rather than an isolated technical report.

## How Much Does an SEO Audit Cost?

SEO audit pricing varies significantly based on scope, depth, and the provider's expertise. Understanding the market helps you evaluate whether you're getting genuine value or paying for an automated report dressed up as consulting.

**Automated tool reports (£0-£50):** Tools like Screaming Frog, Ahrefs Site Audit, and Semrush generate automated crawl reports. These identify surface-level issues — broken links, missing meta descriptions, duplicate titles — but provide no strategic interpretation or prioritisation. They're useful for monitoring but insufficient as a standalone audit.

**Freelance SEO audits (£200-£800):** Independent consultants typically deliver manual analysis combining tool data with expert interpretation. This is where my [technical SEO audit pricing](/services/how-much-does-seo-cost/) sits — starting from £500 for sites under 100 pages. You get a prioritised action plan, competitor benchmarking, and a consultation call to discuss implementation.

**Agency-level audits (£1,500-£10,000+):** Larger agencies charge premium rates reflecting their overhead costs. The deliverables are often similar to freelance audits, though enterprise-level audits covering sites with thousands of pages genuinely require more resource.

The most important factor isn't price — it's whether the audit produces actionable recommendations with clear prioritisation. An expensive audit that lists 200 issues without effort/impact scoring wastes development time. A focused audit identifying the 15 changes that will move the needle delivers genuine ROI.
