## What is a Topical Map?

A topical map is a strategic content architecture that organises topics around a central entity to build topical authority. The topical map defines which pages to create, how they connect through internal links, and the publication sequence for maximum ranking impact. Topical maps transform scattered content into cohesive semantic networks that search engines recognise as authoritative.

## How Does Topical Map Creation Work?

Topical map creation follows a 5-step methodology:

**Source context definition** identifies your business model, monetisation strategy, and conversion alignment to ensure content serves business goals rather than generating vanity traffic.

**Central entity identification** defines the site-wide topic that appears across all pages, unifying your content under a recognisable authority signal search engines can evaluate.

**Core and outer section mapping** separates money pages where conversions happen from authority-building content that generates impressions and internally links to core pages.

**Entity-attribute pair development** creates specific page topics with measurable search demand, avoiding vague subjects that lack clear search intent or competitive advantage.

**Internal linking architecture** designs hub-and-spoke connections between pages, distributing ranking signals effectively whilst guiding users through logical content journeys.

## What Does the Topical Map Deliverable Include?

The topical map package includes 6 deliverables:

**Strategic foundation document** defines source context, central entity, and central search intent, creating the conceptual framework that guides all subsequent content decisions.

**Raw topical map** provides complete list of entity-attribute pairs with search volumes, showing the full topic space you'll address to establish authority.

**Processed topical map** includes optimised title tags, URL slugs, and meta descriptions for each page, removing guesswork from content creation.

**Internal linking matrix** specifies page-to-page connections with anchor text recommendations, ensuring ranking signals flow toward conversion pages effectively.

**Publication schedule** prioritises content calendar with momentum planning, identifying which pages to publish first for maximum early ranking impact.

**Competitor gap analysis** reveals topics competitors cover that you should address, alongside opportunities where competitors lack comprehensive coverage.

## How Much Does Topical Map Creation Cost?

Topical map pricing depends on scope and industry complexity:

-   Focused topical map (20-30 pages): £800
-   Comprehensive topical map (50-100 pages): £1,500
-   Enterprise topical map (100+ pages): £2,500+

Most businesses start with a focused map addressing their primary service area, then expand into adjacent topics as initial content gains traction. The map feeds directly into [content brief development](/content-briefs/), with each page specification becoming a detailed writing brief.

## What Makes Topical Maps More Effective Than Keyword Lists?

Traditional keyword research produces disconnected lists of search terms without strategic context. Topical maps create hierarchical relationships between topics, defining how pages support each other through internal links. This architecture approach aligns with how search engines evaluate [topical authority](/what-is-topical-authority/) rather than isolated keyword relevance.

The methodology follows [semantic SEO](/what-is-semantic-seo/) principles, covering entire subject areas comprehensively instead of cherry-picking high-volume keywords. Sites built on topical maps rank for queries they never directly targeted because search engines recognise genuine authority.
