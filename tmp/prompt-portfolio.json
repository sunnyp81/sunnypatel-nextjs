Each card is a tiny rectangle with different colored accent lines (blue, green, gold, teal). Some cards glow brighter than others indicating top performers. The number 45 is displayed prominently in large bold white text on the left side. Clean dark background (#0a0a0a). Subtle connecting lines between the cards suggest a network.
